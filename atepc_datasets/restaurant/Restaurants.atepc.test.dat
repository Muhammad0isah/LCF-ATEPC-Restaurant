I O -1 3
suggest O -1 3
only O -1 3
eating O -1 3
one O -1 3
with O -1 3
meat B-ASP 1 3
because O -1 3
they O -1 3
tend O -1 3
not O -1 3
to O -1 3

served B-ASP 2 3

We O -1 3
had O -1 3
the O -1 3

and O -1 3
a O -1 3
tempura O -1 3
dish O -1 3
that O -1 3
was O -1 3
great. O -1 3

I O -1 3
was O -1 3
especially O -1 3
impressed O -1 3
during O -1 3
the O -1 3
bday O -1 3

when O -1 3
the O -1 3

Overall, O -1 3
I'm O -1 3
still O -1 3
impressed O -1 3
that O -1 3
the O -1 3
place O -1 3
even O -1 3
exists O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
prices B-ASP 2 3

quite O -1 3
decent O -1 3

then O -1 3
again, O -1 3

the O -1 3

that O -1 0
you O -1 0

also, O -1 3
the O -1 3

We O -1 3

(including O -1 3
the O -1 3

The O -1 3

do O -1 3
not O -1 3

The O -1 3

very O -1 3

it. O -1 3

As O -1 0
far O -1 0
as O -1 0
the O -1 0

goes, O -1 0
the O -1 0

not O -1 0
particularly O -1 0

but O -1 0
they O -1 0

the O -1 3
food O -1 3
and O -1 3
service B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
amazing. O -1 3

Eating O -1 0
in, O -1 0
the O -1 0
atmosphere B-ASP 2 0
saves O -1 0
it, O -1 0
but O -1 0
at O -1 0
your O -1 0
desk, O -1 0
it's O -1 0
a O -1 0
very O -1 0
disappointing O -1 0
experience. O -1 0

The O -1 0
food B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
not O -1 0
fresh, O -1 0
the O -1 0
sauces O -1 0
were O -1 0
bland O -1 0
and O -1 0
very O -1 0
oily. O -1 0

If O -1 0
you O -1 0
are O -1 0
here O -1 0
as O -1 0
a O -1 0
pre-show B-ASP 1 0
meal, I-ASP 1 0
hop O -1 0
in O -1 0
a O -1 0
cab O -1 0
and O -1 0
take O -1 0
the O -1 0
extra O -1 0
10 O -1 0
minutes O -1 0
to O -1 0
go O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
uptown O -1 0
location. O -1 0

Our O -1 3
family O -1 3
never O -1 3
expected O -1 3
such O -1 3
incredible O -1 3
entertainment B-ASP 2 3
in O -1 3
a O -1 3
restaurant. O -1 3

The O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
looks O -1 3
out O -1 3
over O -1 3
beautiful O -1 3

the O -1 3
Hudson O -1 3

the O -1 3

Liberty. O -1 3

The O -1 3
manager O -1 3
then O -1 3
told O -1 3
us O -1 3
we O -1 3
could O -1 3
order O -1 3
from O -1 3
whatever(1) O -1 3
menu O -1 3
we O -1 3
wanted O -1 3
but O -1 3
by O -1 3
that O -1 3
time O -1 3
we O -1 3
were O -1 3
so O -1 3
annoyed(2) O -1 3
with O -1 3
the O -1 3
waiter O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
resturant O -1 3
that O -1 3
we O -1 3
let O -1 3
and O -1 3
went O -1 3
some O -1 3

most O -1 4

I O -1 4

the O -1 4

One O -1 2
caveat: O -1 2
Some O -1 2
of O -1 2
the O -1 2

can O -1 2
be O -1 2

The O -1 3
spicy O -1 3

I O -1 3

him, O -1 3
is O -1 3
a O -1 3
real O -1 3

and O -1 3
a O -1 3
real O -1 3
Roman. O -1 3

The O -1 3
steak B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
excellent O -1 3
and O -1 3
one O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
I O -1 3
have O -1 3
had(1) O -1 3
(I O -1 3
tasted O -1 3
the O -1 3
butter O -1 3
intitally O -1 3
but O -1 3
in O -1 3
no O -1 3
way O -1 3
did O -1 3
it O -1 3
overwhelm(2) O -1 3
the O -1 3

Great O -1 3
spot, B-ASP 2 3
whether O -1 3
looking O -1 3
for O -1 3
a O -1 3
couple O -1 3
of O -1 3

quiet O -1 3

in O -1 3

or O -1 3
Can't O -1 3
is O -1 3
not O -1 3
in O -1 3

In O -1 2
reality O -1 2
(to O -1 2
maximize O -1 2
potential O -1 2
diners) B-ASP 1 2
they O -1 2
were O -1 2
still O -1 2
taking O -1 2
phone O -1 2
reservations O -1 2
and O -1 2
reallocating O -1 2
tables O -1 2
of O -1 2
those O -1 2
waiting O -1 2
in O -1 2
the O -1 2
lobby. O -1 2

There O -1 3
was O -1 3
a O -1 3
long O -1 3
wait O -1 3
for O -1 3
a O -1 3
table B-ASP 1 3
outside, O -1 3
but O -1 3
it O -1 3
was O -1 3
a O -1 3
little O -1 3
too O -1 3
hot O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
sun O -1 3
anyway O -1 3
so O -1 3
our O -1 3
insde O -1 3
table O -1 3
was O -1 3
very O -1 3
nice. O -1 3

While O -1 3
the O -1 3
$20 O -1 3
entree B-ASP 2 3
range I-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
not O -1 3
overly O -1 3
expensive, O -1 3
in O -1 3
New O -1 3
York O -1 3
City, O -1 3
there O -1 3
is O -1 3
definitely O -1 3
better O -1 3
food O -1 3
in O -1 3
that O -1 3
range, O -1 3
and O -1 3
so O -1 3
Sapphire, O -1 3
despite O -1 3
it's O -1 3
lovely O -1 3
atmosphere, O -1 3
will O -1 3
most O -1 3
likely O -1 3
not O -1 3
be O -1 3
a O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
to O -1 3
which O -1 3
I O -1 3
will O -1 3
return. O -1 3

I O -1 3
can O -1 3
say O -1 3
that O -1 3
the O -1 3
wraps, O -1 3
burgers O -1 3
and O -1 3
salads B-ASP 2 3
were O -1 3
all O -1 3
fresh, O -1 3
tasty(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
mango O -1 3
margareta O -1 3
at O -1 3
$9 O -1 3
was O -1 3
WELL O -1 3
WORTH O -1 3
the O -1 3
money(2). O -1 3

my O -1 3
picks O -1 3
are: O -1 3
- O -1 3
Scallion O -1 3
Pancake O -1 3
(fried O -1 3
with O -1 3
vegetable O -1 3

that O -1 2
looks O -1 2
like O -1 2
he O -1 2
is O -1 2

then O -1 2
this O -1 2
is O -1 2
your O -1 2
place. O -1 2

Nevertheless O -1 3
the O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
itself O -1 3
is O -1 3
pretty O -1 3
good. O -1 3

I O -1 3
can O -1 3
say O -1 3
that O -1 3
the O -1 3
wraps, O -1 3
burgers B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
salads O -1 3
were O -1 3
all O -1 3
fresh, O -1 3
tasty(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
mango O -1 3
margareta O -1 3
at O -1 3
$9 O -1 3
was O -1 3
WELL O -1 3
WORTH O -1 3

money(2). O -1 3

If O -1 3
you O -1 3
love O -1 3
seafood, O -1 3
you O -1 3
would O -1 3
love O -1 3
this O -1 3
place! B-ASP 2 3

I O -1 3
would O -1 3
only O -1 3
go O -1 3
for O -1 3
the O -1 3
coffee B-ASP 2 3
which O -1 3
is O -1 3
way O -1 3
better O -1 3
than O -1 3
Starbucks O -1 3
or O -1 3
the O -1 3
like. O -1 3

The O -1 3
ambience B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
pretty O -1 3
and O -1 3
nice O -1 3
for O -1 3
conversation(1), O -1 3
so O -1 3
a O -1 3
casual O -1 3
lunch O -1 3
here O -1 3
would O -1 3
probably O -1 3
be O -1 3
best(2). O -1 3

also O -1 2
make O -1 2
sure O -1 2
you O -1 2
pay O -1 2
attention O -1 2
to O -1 2
the O -1 2
music B-ASP 1 2
being O -1 2
piped O -1 2
in O -1 2
- O -1 2
quite O -1 2
a O -1 2
weird O -1 2
selection. O -1 2

The O -1 3
beverages B-ASP 2 3
were O -1 3
excellent, O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
dessert O -1 3
was O -1 3
good. O -1 3

$6 O -1 3

there O -1 3

all O -1 3
of O -1 3
it O -1 3
fresh O -1 3

continually O -1 3
refilled. O -1 3

Quality O -1 3
of O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
excellent O -1 3
and O -1 3
price O -1 3
is O -1 3
cheap, O -1 3
stick O -1 3
to O -1 3
pork, O -1 3
fish, O -1 3
chicken, O -1 3
lamb O -1 3
and O -1 3
vegetables. B-ASP 2 3

The O -1 3
only O -1 3
thing O -1 3
more O -1 3
wonderful O -1 3
than O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
(which O -1 3
is O -1 3
exceptional) O -1 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
service. B-ASP 2 3

The O -1 3
anti-pasta O -1 3
was O -1 3
excellent, O -1 3
especially O -1 3
the O -1 3
calamari, O -1 3
as O -1 3
were O -1 3
the O -1 3

mains. I-ASP 2 3

Go O -1 3
here O -1 3
for O -1 3
a O -1 3
romantic O -1 3

but O -1 3
not O -1 3
for O -1 3
an O -1 3
all O -1 3
out O -1 3
wow O -1 3

experience. O -1 3

I O -1 3

To O -1 0

the O -1 0

The O -1 3
people B-ASP 2 3
that O -1 3
work O -1 3
there O -1 3
are O -1 3
always O -1 3
so O -1 3
friendly O -1 3
you O -1 3
forget O -1 3
you O -1 3
are O -1 3
in O -1 3
New O -1 3
York O -1 3
sometimes. O -1 3

During O -1 0
the O -1 0
course O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
past O -1 0
3 O -1 0
months, O -1 0
the O -1 0
chef B-ASP 0 0
and O -1 0
staff O -1 0
changed O -1 0
and O -1 0
it O -1 0
was O -1 0
not O -1 0
for O -1 0
the O -1 0
better. O -1 0

The O -1 3
food O -1 3
here O -1 3
does O -1 3
a O -1 3
great O -1 3
service O -1 3
to O -1 3
the O -1 3
name O -1 3
(Cantonese B-ASP 2 3
that O -1 3
is...). O -1 3

The O -1 3
pizza B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
if O -1 3
you O -1 3
like O -1 3
thin O -1 3
crusted O -1 3
pizza. O -1 3

Admittedly O -1 1
some O -1 1
nights O -1 1
inside O -1 1
the O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
were O -1 1
rather O -1 1
warm, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
open B-ASP 2 1
kitchen I-ASP 2 1
is O -1 1
part O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
charm. O -1 1

After O -1 0
passing O -1 0
by O -1 0
this O -1 0
restaurant O -1 0
for O -1 0
sometime O -1 0
I O -1 0
finally O -1 0
decided O -1 0
to O -1 0
go O -1 0
in O -1 0
and O -1 0
have O -1 0
dinner. B-ASP 1 0

Even O -1 3
with O -1 3
a O -1 3
relatively O -1 3
inexpensive(1) O -1 3
botle O -1 3
of O -1 3
wine, O -1 3
if O -1 3
you O -1 3
can O -1 3
call O -1 3
$70.00 O -1 3
inexpensive, O -1 3
the O -1 3
cost O -1 3
is O -1 3
through O -1 3
the O -1 3
roof O -1 3
for O -1 3
better O -1 3
than O -1 3
average O -1 3
fare(2). O -1 3

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 3 3
is O -1 3
just O -1 3
OKAY(1), O -1 3
and O -1 3
it's O -1 3
almost O -1 3
not O -1 3
worth O -1 3
going O -1 3
unless O -1 3
you're O -1 3
getting(2) O -1 3
the O -1 3
pialla, O -1 3
which O -1 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
only O -1 3
dish O -1 3
that's O -1 3
really O -1 3
good(3). O -1 3

Be O -1 3
sure O -1 3
to O -1 3
try O -1 3
the O -1 3
Smoked O -1 3
Trout...Lamb O -1 3
Chops, O -1 3
Veal O -1 3

on O -1 3
and O -1 3
on O -1 3
and O -1 3
on... O -1 3

The O -1 3
pasta B-ASP 2 3
primavera I-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
outstanding(1) O -1 3
as O -1 3
well, O -1 3
lots O -1 3
of(2) O -1 3
fresh O -1 3
veggies. O -1 3

The O -1 1
menu B-ASP 1 1
choices I-ASP 1 1
are O -1 1
similar O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
taste O -1 1
lacked O -1 1
more O -1 1
flavor O -1 1
than O -1 1
it O -1 1
looked. O -1 1

So O -1 3
if O -1 3
you O -1 3
want O -1 3
a O -1 3
nice, O -1 3
enjoyable O -1 3
meal O -1 3
at O -1 3
Montparnasse, O -1 3
go O -1 3
early O -1 3
for O -1 3
the O -1 3

The O -1 3

everything O -1 3

if O -1 3
I O -1 3
could O -1 3
of O -1 3

the O -1 3

every O -1 3

All O -1 3
in O -1 3
all, O -1 3
this O -1 3
midtown O -1 3

instantly O -1 3
became O -1 3

of O -1 3
my O -1 3

Ummm...the O -1 3
beer B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
cold. O -1 3

The O -1 1
food's O -1 1
dazzling O -1 1

overwhelm O -1 1
the O -1 1

truly O -1 1

the O -1 1

of O -1 1

to O -1 3

a O -1 0
restaurant O -1 0
with O -1 0
6 O -1 0
tables) O -1 0

got O -1 0
our O -1 0

The O -1 0
only O -1 0
fallback O -1 0
on O -1 0
this O -1 0
restaurant O -1 0
is O -1 0
the O -1 0

The O -1 2
food B-ASP 0 2
was O -1 2
just O -1 2
awful, O -1 2
ATROCIOUS O -1 2
actually. O -1 2

The O -1 3
ambiance O -1 3
is O -1 3
minimal(1) O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
not O -1 3
phenomenal(2), O -1 3
but O -1 3
some O -1 3
dishes O -1 3
are O -1 3
quite O -1 3
good(3), O -1 3
such O -1 3
as I-ASP 2 3
the I-ASP 2 3
eggplant I-ASP 2 3
parmesan, O -1 3
veal O -1 3
in O -1 3
carozza O -1 3
chicken O -1 3
saltimbocca. O -1 3

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 1 3
however, O -1 3
is O -1 3
what O -1 3
one O -1 3
might O -1 3
expect. O -1 3

The O -1 1
entree B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
bland O -1 1
and O -1 1
small, O -1 1
dessert O -1 1
was O -1 1
not O -1 1
inspired. O -1 1

Everything O -1 3
is O -1 3
always O -1 3
cooked O -1 3
to O -1 3
perfection, O -1 3
the O -1 3
service B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
excellent, O -1 3
the O -1 3
decor O -1 3
cool O -1 3
and O -1 3
understated. O -1 3

The O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
great(1) O -1 3
- O -1 3
sushi O -1 3
was O -1 3
good(2), O -1 3
but O -1 3
the I-ASP 2 3
cooked O -1 3
food O -1 3
amazed O -1 3
us(3). O -1 3

My O -1 3
husband O -1 3
and O -1 3
I O -1 3
have O -1 3
been O -1 3
there O -1 3
at O -1 3

6 O -1 3

we've O -1 3
always O -1 3
been O -1 3
given O -1 3
the O -1 3

the O -1 0

pay O -1 0
for O -1 0
them. O -1 0

I O -1 3

the O -1 3

you O -1 3
how O -1 3
delicious(1) O -1 3
that O -1 3
was O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3

was O -1 3
beatiful(2). O -1 3

The O -1 3
dishes O -1 3
offered O -1 3
were O -1 3
unique, O -1 3
very O -1 3
tasty O -1 3
and O -1 3
fresh O -1 3
from O -1 3
the O -1 3
lamb O -1 3

(the O -1 3
best O -1 3
and O -1 3
freshest O -1 3
I've O -1 3

had). O -1 3

In O -1 2
reality O -1 2
(to O -1 2
maximize O -1 2
potential O -1 2
diners) O -1 2
they O -1 2
were O -1 2

The O -1 3
Pastrami O -1 3
sandwich O -1 3
was O -1 3
like O -1 3
buttah O -1 3
and O -1 3
with O -1 3

and O -1 3
an O -1 3
icy O -1 3
cold O -1 3

wash O -1 3
it O -1 3
down, O -1 3
it O -1 3
was O -1 3
a O -1 3
pleasurable O -1 3
experience. O -1 3

The O -1 0
service B-ASP 1 0
was O -1 0
mediocre(1), O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
lack(2) O -1 0
of O -1 0
air O -1 0

made O -1 0
for O -1 0
a O -1 0
less O -1 0
than O -1 0
comfortable(3) O -1 0
meal. O -1 0

Its O -1 0
a O -1 0
go-to O -1 0
for O -1 0
dates O -1 0
as O -1 0
well O -1 0
as O -1 0
entertaining B-ASP 2 0
out O -1 0
of O -1 0

The O -1 0
Thali B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
small, O -1 0
thoroughly O -1 0
unremarkable, O -1 0
and O -1 0
$14.95. O -1 0

All O -1 0
the O -1 0
money O -1 0
went O -1 0
into O -1 0
the O -1 0
interior O -1 0

none O -1 0

Their O -1 3
Margarita B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
best O -1 3
I've O -1 3
had O -1 3
since O -1 3
I've O -1 3
returned O -1 3
from O -1 3
Naples! O -1 3

The O -1 1
place B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
tight O -1 1
and O -1 1
on O -1 1
a O -1 1
cold O -1 1
day, O -1 1
the O -1 1
seating O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
entranceway O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
pretty O -1 1
drafty. O -1 1

The O -1 1
noise B-ASP 0 1
level I-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
unbearable, O -1 1
conversation O -1 1
impossible. O -1 1

All O -1 3
toppings O -1 3
are O -1 3
so O -1 3
fresh O -1 3
you'd O -1 3
think O -1 3
they O -1 3
had O -1 3
their O -1 3
own O -1 3
vegetable O -1 3
garden(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
crust O -1 3
is O -1 3
so O -1 3
perfect, O -1 3
that O -1 3
one O -1 3
actually O -1 3
thinks O -1 3
of O -1 3
how O -1 3
it O -1 3
was O -1 3
made(2). O -1 3

I O -1 4
know O -1 4
real O -1 4
Indian B-ASP 0 4
food I-ASP 0 4
and O -1 4
this O -1 4
wasn't O -1 4
it. O -1 4

Two O -1 0
complaints(1)- O -1 0
their O -1 0
appetizer I-ASP 0 0
selection O -1 0
stinks, O -1 0
it O -1 0
would O -1 0
be O -1 0
nice O -1 0
to O -1 0
get O -1 0
some(2) O -1 0
mozzarella O -1 0
sticks O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
menu. O -1 0

I O -1 3
found O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
to O -1 3
be O -1 3
outstanding, O -1 3
particulary O -1 3
the O -1 3
salmon B-ASP 2 3
dish I-ASP 2 3
I O -1 3
had. O -1 3

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
good. O -1 3

The O -1 1
rice B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
poor O -1 1
quality O -1 1
and O -1 1
was O -1 1
cooked O -1 1
so O -1 1
badly O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
hard. O -1 1

Fish B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
overdone. O -1 0

The O -1 0
falafal B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
rather O -1 0
over O -1 0
cooked O -1 0
and O -1 0
dried(1) O -1 0
but O -1 0
the O -1 0
chicken O -1 0
was O -1 0
fine(2). O -1 0

For O -1 0
all O -1 0
of O -1 0
you O -1 0
new O -1 0
to O -1 0
Indian O -1 0
food, O -1 0
try O -1 0
the O -1 0
Paneer B-ASP 2 0
Roll, I-ASP 2 0
it O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
piece O -1 0
of O -1 0
heaven. O -1 0

There O -1 1
is O -1 1
also O -1 1
very O -1 1
limited O -1 1
seating B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
there O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
a O -1 1
substantial O -1 1
wait O -1 1
in O -1 1
getting O -1 1
food O -1 1
at O -1 1
peak O -1 1
times. O -1 1

Go O -1 3
with(1) O -1 3
the O -1 3
specials, O -1 3
and O -1 3
stay O -1 3
away O -1 3
from(2) O -1 3
the O -1 3
salmon. O -1 3

However, O -1 1
looking O -1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
next O -1 1
to O -1 1
ours, O -1 1
we O -1 1
both O -1 1

we O -1 1
had O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
pizza, B-ASP 2 1
which O -1 1
looked O -1 1
PERRRRRRRRRFECT. O -1 1

Even O -1 3
the O -1 3
pasta B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
delicious O -1 3
here O -1 3
(a O -1 3
rarity O -1 3
in O -1 3
New O -1 3
York O -1 3
pizza O -1 3
restaurants). O -1 3

Lucky O -1 3

I'm O -1 3
a O -1 3
big O -1 3

and O -1 3
could O -1 3
only O -1 3

while O -1 3
my O -1 3

a O -1 3
basketful O -1 3

Don't O -1 1
expect O -1 1
to O -1 1
sit O -1 1
down O -1 1
inside O -1 1
though, O -1 1
there O -1 1
are O -1 1
only O -1 1
a O -1 1
few O -1 1
tables B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
are O -1 1
always O -1 1
full. O -1 1

Toons O -1 3
has O -1 3
recently O -1 3
been O -1 3
redone, O -1 3
so O -1 3
it's O -1 3
now O -1 3
a O -1 3
very O -1 3
attractive O -1 3
space. B-ASP 2 3

Oh, O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
complimentary O -1 3
pudding B-ASP 2 3
dessert I-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
just O -1 3
enough- O -1 3
yummy! O -1 3

My O -1 3
host B-ASP 1 3
asked O -1 3
for O -1 3
appetizers O -1 3
for O -1 3
the O -1 3
group O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
waiter O -1 3
gave O -1 3
us O -1 3
not O -1 3
only O -1 3
what O -1 3
we O -1 3
ordered, O -1 3
but O -1 3
some O -1 3
other O -1 3
items O -1 3
that O -1 3
were O -1 3
not O -1 3
ordered. O -1 3

The O -1 5
service O -1 5
is O -1 5
outstanding(1) O -1 5
and O -1 5
my B-ASP 2 5
crab-cake I-ASP 2 5
eggs I-ASP 2 5
benedict O -1 5
could O -1 5
not O -1 5
have O -1 5
been O -1 5
better(2). O -1 5

The O -1 3
setting B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
casual O -1 3
and O -1 3
romantic. O -1 3

The O -1 0
chicken O -1 0
parm O -1 0
was O -1 0
edible O -1 0
(1) O -1 0
but O -1 0
had O -1 0
canned O -1 0
tomato O -1 0
sauce O -1 0
and O -1 0
boxed O -1 0
pasta O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0

with O -1 0
portobello O -1 0

consisted O -1 0
of O -1 0
dry, O -1 0
inedible(2) O -1 0
chicken O -1 0
with O -1 0
terrible(3) O -1 0
sauce. O -1 0

It O -1 3
was O -1 3
good(1), O -1 3
but O -1 3
none O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
flavors O -1 3
WOW(2). O -1 3

This O -1 3
is O -1 3
such O -1 3
a O -1 3
lovely, O -1 3
peaceful O -1 3
place B-ASP 2 3
to O -1 3
eat O -1 3
outside. O -1 3

And O -1 3
it O -1 3
all O -1 3
comes O -1 3
at O -1 3
a O -1 3
very O -1 3
reasonable O -1 3
price B-ASP 2 3
(congee, O -1 3

no O -1 3
more O -1 3

After O -1 1

by O -1 1
the O -1 1

to O -1 1
take O -1 1

away O -1 1
(we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
it O -1 1
yet, O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
full O -1 1
beers O -1 1
yet O -1 1
to O -1 1
drink), O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager B-ASP 0 1
approached O -1 1
and O -1 1
told O -1 1
us O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
for O -1 1
people O -1 1
with O -1 1
reservations. O -1 1

The O -1 3
service B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
attentive O -1 3
and O -1 3
her O -1 3
suggestions O -1 3
of O -1 3
menu O -1 3

was O -1 3
right O -1 3
on O -1 3

I O -1 3
went O -1 3

past O -1 3
Saturday O -1 3

a O -1 3
braised O -1 3
lamb O -1 3
shank O -1 3
with O -1 3
mashed O -1 3
potatoes. O -1 3

It's O -1 5
like O -1 5
they O -1 5
took O -1 5
leftover O -1 5
chicken, B-ASP 0 5
poured O -1 5
oil O -1 5
and O -1 5
sprinkled O -1 5
pepper O -1 5

over O -1 5
it O -1 5
(the O -1 5
sauce O -1 5
was O -1 5
translucent O -1 5
and O -1 5
red). O -1 5

I O -1 3

the O -1 3

Although O -1 2
the O -1 2

I O -1 2
prefer O -1 2
not O -1 2

Always O -1 3

the O -1 3

forgettable. O -1 3

They O -1 5
did O -1 5
not O -1 5

The O -1 3

he O -1 3
could've O -1 3
eaten O -1 3

No O -1 3
you're O -1 3
going O -1 3

the O -1 3

I've O -1 2
overheard O -1 2
comments O -1 2
from O -1 2
him(1) O -1 2
to O -1 2
his O -1 2

that O -1 2

The O -1 3

while O -1 3
the O -1 3

the O -1 3

I O -1 3

the O -1 3

The O -1 0

personally O -1 0
I'd O -1 0

Have O -1 3
always O -1 3
found O -1 3
that O -1 3
the O -1 3
waiters B-ASP 2 3
will O -1 3
go O -1 3
out O -1 3
of O -1 3
their O -1 3
way O -1 3
to O -1 3
be O -1 3
helpful, O -1 3
despite O -1 3
the O -1 3
fact O -1 3
they O -1 3
are O -1 3
often O -1 3
busy O -1 3
with O -1 3
lots O -1 3
of O -1 3
diners. O -1 3

It's O -1 1
super-trendy O -1 1
and O -1 1
there's O -1 1
always O -1 1
someone O -1 1
to O -1 1
take O -1 1
that O -1 1
empty O -1 1
seat, O -1 1
so O -1 1
it O -1 1
seems O -1 1
that O -1 1
customer O -1 1
service B-ASP 2 1
has O -1 1
been O -1 1
deemed O -1 1
not O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
essence. O -1 1

Of O -1 3
course O -1 3
the O -1 3
reason O -1 3
its O -1 3
so O -1 3
packed O -1 3
is O -1 3
because O -1 3
the O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
so O -1 3
delicious! O -1 3

Good O -1 3

really O -1 3
tasty. O -1 3

Stick O -1 3
to(1) O -1 3
dimsum, O -1 3
not O -1 3
super O -1 3
overpriced(2) O -1 3
noodles. O -1 3

I O -1 3
choose O -1 3
to O -1 3
go O -1 3
with O -1 3
one O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
special, O -1 3
the O -1 3
braised B-ASP 2 3
lamb I-ASP 2 3

in I-ASP 2 3
red I-ASP 2 3

which O -1 3
was O -1 3
excellent. O -1 3

I O -1 4
came O -1 4
to O -1 4
fresh O -1 4
expecting O -1 4
a O -1 4
great(1) O -1 4

and O -1 4
all O -1 4
I O -1 4
got O -1 4
was O -1 4
marginally O -1 4
so-so(2) O -1 4
food O -1 4
served O -1 4
in O -1 4
a O -1 4
restaurant O -1 4
that O -1 4
was O -1 4
just O -1 4
so O -1 4
freezing O -1 4
we O -1 4
couldn't O -1 4
enjoy O -1 4
eating(3). O -1 4

The O -1 3
place B-ASP 2 3

larger O -1 3
than O -1 3
most O -1 3
and O -1 3
features O -1 3
adequate O -1 3
seating O -1 3
unlike O -1 3
most O -1 3
joints, O -1 3
and O -1 3
has O -1 3
a O -1 3

which O -1 3
deserves O -1 3
a O -1 3
mention. O -1 3

Try O -1 0
the O -1 0

yet O -1 3
the O -1 3

the O -1 3

the O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
one O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
city O -1 3
of O -1 3
New O -1 3

The O -1 3
place O -1 3
is O -1 3
small O -1 3
and O -1 3
intimate O -1 3
and O -1 3
you O -1 3
may O -1 3
feel O -1 3
a O -1 3

up O -1 3
a O -1 3

the O -1 3

shrimp, O -1 3
okra B-ASP 2 3
(bindi), I-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
anything O -1 3

My O -1 3

had O -1 3
the O -1 3
New B-ASP 2 3
England I-ASP 2 3
Chowder I-ASP 2 3
it O -1 3
was O -1 3
good O -1 3
but O -1 3
I O -1 3
think O -1 3
the O -1 3
award O -1 3
should O -1 3
go O -1 3
to O -1 3
the O -1 3
Lobster O -1 3
Bisque. O -1 3

Their O -1 3
sushi, O -1 3
Kamikaze O -1 3
and O -1 3
other O -1 3
Rolls B-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
fresh O -1 3
and O -1 3
well O -1 3

The O -1 0
manager O -1 0
claimed O -1 0
that O -1 0
he O -1 0
could O -1 0
not O -1 0
compensate O -1 0
us O -1 0
for O -1 0
anything O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
bill B-ASP 1 0
which O -1 0
just O -1 0
shows O -1 0
the O -1 0
lack O -1 0
of O -1 0
sophistication O -1 0
from O -1 0
the O -1 0
entire O -1 0
group. O -1 0

The O -1 3
garlic B-ASP 2 3
mashed I-ASP 2 3
potatoes I-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
hands O -1 3
down O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
city! O -1 3

Good, O -1 3
dark O -1 3
atmosphere O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
music B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
a O -1 3
nice O -1 3
touch. O -1 3

The O -1 1
food B-ASP 3 1
was O -1 1
very O -1 1
expensive O -1 1
(we O -1 1
spent O -1 1
$160 O -1 1
for O -1 1
lunch O -1 1
for O -1 1
two) O -1 1
but O -1 1
extremely O -1 1
tasty. O -1 1

They O -1 3
are O -1 3
served O -1 3
with O -1 3
a O -1 3
free(1) O -1 3
appetizer O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
portions O -1 3
are O -1 3
perfect(2) O -1 3
for I-ASP 1 3
lunch. O -1 3

Food O -1 3
was O -1 3
average O -1 3
and O -1 3
creme B-ASP 0 3
brulee I-ASP 0 3
was O -1 3
awful O -1 3
- O -1 3
the O -1 3
sugar O -1 3
was O -1 3
charred, O -1 3
not O -1 3
caramelized O -1 3
and O -1 3
smelled O -1 3
of O -1 3
kerosene. O -1 3

But O -1 2
don't O -1 2
ever O -1 2
order O -1 2
bacon O -1 2

that O -1 2

don't O -1 2

hard O -1 2
almost O -1 2
like O -1 2
bacos, O -1 2

my O -1 2

The O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
slow, O -1 1
but O -1 1
harkens O -1 1
back O -1 1
to O -1 1
my O -1 1
years O -1 1
growing O -1 1
up O -1 1
in O -1 1
Napoli, O -1 1
Italy O -1 1
where O -1 1
things O -1 1
are O -1 1
not O -1 1
rushed O -1 1
and O -1 1
when O -1 1
you O -1 1
sit O -1 1
down O -1 1
for O -1 1
dinner O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
is O -1 1
yours O -1 1
all O -1 1
night. O -1 1

The O -1 3
soup B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
pretty O -1 3
good O -1 3
too. O -1 3

I O -1 0
had O -1 0

the O -1 0

sampler O -1 0
with O -1 0
a O -1 0
dessert B-ASP 2 0
wine I-ASP 2 0
for O -1 0
$49. O -1 0

The O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
very O -1 3
good O -1 3
too O -1 3
but O -1 3
for O -1 3
the O -1 3
most O -1 3
part, O -1 3
it's O -1 3
just O -1 3
regular O -1 3
food, B-ASP 1 3
nothing O -1 3
special. O -1 3

While O -1 3
they O -1 3
keep O -1 3
the O -1 3
capex B-ASP 2 3
to O -1 3
a O -1 3
minimum, O -1 3
they O -1 3
do O -1 3
put O -1 3
some O -1 3
cash O -1 3
into O -1 3
the O -1 3
bagels, O -1 3
because O -1 3
they O -1 3
among O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
city. O -1 3

My O -1 3
husband O -1 3

the O -1 3

portions B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
left O -1 3
completely O -1 3
full. O -1 3

The O -1 3
bartenders O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
managers B-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
really O -1 3
nice(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
decor O -1 3
is O -1 3
very O -1 3
comfy O -1 3
and O -1 3
laid-back(2), O -1 3
all O -1 3
the O -1 3
while O -1 3
being O -1 3
trendy. O -1 3

They O -1 5
wouldnt O -1 5
even O -1 5
let O -1 5
me O -1 5
finish O -1 5
my O -1 5
glass B-ASP 1 5
of I-ASP 1 5
wine I-ASP 1 5
before O -1 5
offering O -1 5
another. O -1 5

However, O -1 5
they've O -1 5
got O -1 5
the O -1 5
most O -1 5
amazing O -1 5
pastrami O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
soups B-ASP 2 5
hit O -1 5
the O -1 5
spot. O -1 5

Well, O -1 1
it O -1 1
happened O -1 1
because O -1 1
of O -1 1
a O -1 1
graceless(1) O -1 1
manager O -1 1
and O -1 1
a O -1 1
rude(2) O -1 1
bartender O -1 1
who O -1 1
had O -1 1
us O -1 1
waiting O -1 1
20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
for(3) O -1 1
drinks, O -1 1
and O -1 1
then O -1 1
tells O -1 1
us O -1 1
to O -1 1
chill O -1 1
out(4). O -1 1

The O -1 2
menu O -1 2
is O -1 2
very O -1 2
limited O -1 2
- O -1 2
i O -1 2
think O -1 2
we O -1 2
counted O -1 2
4 O -1 2
or O -1 2
5 O -1 2
entrees. B-ASP 0 2

This O -1 5
place O -1 5
has O -1 5
the O -1 5
best O -1 5
pizza. B-ASP 2 5

I O -1 0
have O -1 0
tried O -1 0
to O -1 0
make O -1 0
reservations, O -1 0
but O -1 0
both O -1 0
times, O -1 0
the O -1 0
hostess B-ASP 0 0
didn't O -1 0
have O -1 0
my O -1 0

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
looked O -1 3
very O -1 3
appetizing O -1 3
and O -1 3
delicious O -1 3
since O -1 3
it O -1 3
came O -1 3
on O -1 3
a O -1 3
variety O -1 3
of O -1 3
fancy O -1 3

They O -1 5
need O -1 5
a O -1 5
kick O -1 5
out O -1 5
of O -1 5
it O -1 5
but O -1 5
until O -1 5
then O -1 5
the O -1 5
sushi O -1 5
is O -1 5
pretty O -1 5
good(1) O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
place O -1 5
is O -1 5
consistent(2). O -1 5

If O -1 3
you're O -1 3
looking O -1 3
for O -1 3
a O -1 3
place O -1 3
to O -1 3
sit O -1 3
down, O -1 3
have O -1 3
a O -1 3
drink B-ASP 1 3
and O -1 3

go O -1 3
to O -1 3

and O -1 3
order O -1 3
yourself O -1 3
a O -1 3

We O -1 3
started O -1 3
with O -1 3
lox O -1 3
and O -1 3
mussels B-ASP 2 3
(the O -1 3
best O -1 3

and O -1 3
had O -1 3
the O -1 3
cod O -1 3
and O -1 3
trout O -1 3
for O -1 3
dinner. O -1 3

So O -1 3

more O -1 3
than O -1 3
the O -1 3
usual O -1 3

go O -1 3

I O -1 0
got O -1 0
was O -1 0
the O -1 0

Marscapone, I-ASP 1 0
but O -1 0
they O -1 0
were O -1 0
out O -1 0

While O -1 3
the O -1 3
$20 O -1 3
entree O -1 3
range O -1 3
is O -1 3
not O -1 3
overly O -1 3
expensive, O -1 3
in O -1 3
New O -1 3
York O -1 3
City, O -1 3
there O -1 3
is O -1 3
definitely O -1 3
better O -1 3
food O -1 3
in O -1 3
that O -1 3
range, O -1 3
and O -1 3
so O -1 3
Sapphire, O -1 3
despite O -1 3
it's O -1 3
lovely O -1 3
atmosphere, B-ASP 2 3
will O -1 3
most O -1 3
likely O -1 3
not O -1 3
be O -1 3
a O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
to O -1 3
which O -1 3
I O -1 3
will O -1 3
return. O -1 3

Yes, O -1 1
the O -1 1
prices B-ASP 3 1
are O -1 1
high, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I O -1 1
felt O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
worth O -1 1
it. O -1 1

try O -1 3
the O -1 3
spicy O -1 3
shrimp O -1 3
appetizer O -1 3
(again, O -1 3
not O -1 3
the O -1 3
greatest O -1 3
value O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
world O -1 3
but O -1 3
worth O -1 3
the O -1 3
price(1)) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
lamb I-ASP 2 3
vindaloo O -1 3
is O -1 3
great(2). O -1 3

You O -1 3
are O -1 3
paying O -1 3
for O -1 3
the O -1 3
atmosphere, B-ASP 3 3
which O -1 3
is O -1 3
nice, O -1 3
but O -1 3
can O -1 3
be O -1 3
had O -1 3

Guacamole?? O -1 3

really O -1 3
great, O -1 3
we O -1 3
both O -1 3
had O -1 3
the O -1 3
filet, O -1 3
very O -1 3
good, O -1 3
didn't O -1 3
much O -1 3
like O -1 3
the O -1 3
frites O -1 3
that O -1 3
came O -1 3
with, O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
filet O -1 3
was O -1 3
so O -1 3
good, O -1 3
neither O -1 3
of O -1 3
us O -1 3
cared. O -1 3

Stick O -1 3

at O -1 1
the O -1 1
