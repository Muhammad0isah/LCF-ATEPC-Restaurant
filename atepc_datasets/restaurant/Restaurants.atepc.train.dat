is O -1 3
the O -1 3

say O -1 3
that O -1 3
the O -1 3

all O -1 3

the O -1 3

I O -1 3
almost O -1 3
hesititate O -1 3
to O -1 3
write O -1 3
a O -1 3

the O -1 3

I O -1 3

The O -1 3
service B-ASP 3 3
does O -1 3
sometimes O -1 3
lack O -1 3
focus O -1 3
and O -1 3
it O -1 3
is O -1 3
not O -1 3
ideal O -1 3
if O -1 3
you O -1 3
are O -1 3
in O -1 3
a O -1 3
hurry O -1 3
but O -1 3
I O -1 3
have O -1 3
never O -1 3
been O -1 3
treated O -1 3
rudely. O -1 3

First O -1 0
off, O -1 0
the O -1 0
waitress O -1 0
was O -1 0
completely O -1 0
unattentive O -1 0
the O -1 0
2 O -1 0
times O -1 0
we O -1 0
saw O -1 0
her(odd O -1 0
in O -1 0

got O -1 0
our O -1 0

But O -1 1
that O -1 1
wasn't O -1 1
the O -1 1

the I-ASP 0 1

that O -1 1
resembled O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
I O -1 1
have O -1 1
ever O -1 1
had. O -1 1

The O -1 3
ambience B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
nice, O -1 3
but O -1 3
service O -1 3
wasn't O -1 3
so O -1 3
great. O -1 3

They O -1 3
also O -1 3
have O -1 3
a O -1 3
great(1) O -1 3

The O -1 3
service B-ASP 3 3
is O -1 3
great(1) O -1 3
(maybe O -1 3
even O -1 3
borderline O -1 3
nagging O -1 3
but O -1 3
at O -1 3

you O -1 3

we O -1 3
had O -1 3
a O -1 3
very O -1 3

nothing O -1 3

The O -1 3
dim B-ASP 0 3

ok O -1 3

the O -1 3

they O -1 3

(also O -1 3
note O -1 3

is O -1 0

when O -1 3
I O -1 3

What O -1 3
a O -1 3
difference, O -1 3
the O -1 3
service B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
very O -1 3
comforting(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
better O -1 3
than O -1 3

what O -1 3
really O -1 3

My O -1 3

said O -1 3
the O -1 3

in O -1 3
this O -1 3

the I-ASP 2 3

Although O -1 5

be O -1 5
a O -1 5

more O -1 5

roomier, O -1 5
at O -1 5
the O -1 5
same O -1 5
time, O -1 5
it O -1 5
doesn't O -1 5
really O -1 5
matter. O -1 5

Definitely O -1 3
try O -1 3
the(1) O -1 3
calamari, O -1 3
any O -1 3

even O -1 3
the O -1 3

Guacamole?? O -1 3
appetizer O -1 3
was O -1 3
really O -1 3
great, O -1 3
we O -1 3
both O -1 3
had O -1 3
the O -1 3

very O -1 3
good, O -1 3
didn't O -1 3
much O -1 3
like O -1 3
the O -1 3

that I-ASP 0 3
came O -1 3
with, O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3

was O -1 3
so O -1 3
good, O -1 3
neither O -1 3
of O -1 3
us O -1 3
cared. O -1 3

For O -1 3

I O -1 3
recommend O -1 3
the O -1 3
shrimp O -1 3

The O -1 0

given(2) O -1 0
a O -1 0

I O -1 3
have O -1 3
to O -1 3
say O -1 3
that O -1 3

the O -1 5

the O -1 3

never O -1 3
had O -1 3
Edamame B-ASP 2 3

I O -1 3
thought O -1 3
it O -1 3
was O -1 3
innovative O -1 3
and O -1 3
tasty O -1 3
(could've O -1 3
used O -1 3
a O -1 3
bit O -1 3

First O -1 3

I O -1 3
recomend O -1 3
the O -1 3

Well, O -1 4

not O -1 3
as O -1 3

improved O -1 1

overall O -1 1
this O -1 1

a O -1 1

that O -1 1

the O -1 1

the O -1 3

about O -1 3

could O -1 0
barely O -1 0

the O -1 0

the O -1 0

the O -1 0

I O -1 3
have O -1 3
known O -1 3
about O -1 3
this O -1 3
secret O -1 3
for O -1 3
the O -1 3
last O -1 3
13 O -1 3
years, O -1 3
Emilio(the O -1 3

at O -1 3
mortal(2) O -1 3
prices. O -1 3

This O -1 3

doesn't O -1 3
compare O -1 3

freshness, O -1 3

and O -1 3
consisent(2) O -1 3
quality, O -1 3
but O -1 3
that's O -1 3
just O -1 3
my O -1 3
opinion. O -1 3

The O -1 3
wine O -1 3
is O -1 3
always O -1 3
good, O -1 3
the O -1 3
tapas O -1 3
are O -1 3

we O -1 3

the O -1 3

always O -1 1
someone O -1 1
to O -1 1
take O -1 1
that O -1 1
empty O -1 1

it O -1 1

While O -1 3
the O -1 3

it O -1 3
wasn't O -1 3

not O -1 3

they O -1 3

obliged O -1 3
with O -1 3
two O -1 3

hey, O -1 5

you O -1 5
can O -1 5
try O -1 5
out O -1 5
more O -1 5
dishes O -1 5

smaller(5) O -1 5

because O -1 0
Haru's O -1 0

The O -1 3
design B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
very O -1 3
intimate O -1 3
and O -1 3
romantic. O -1 3

We O -1 0

Food B-ASP 1 3
is O -1 3
average, O -1 3
and O -1 3
I O -1 3
would O -1 3
say O -1 3
even O -1 3
the O -1 3
chain O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
Baluchi's O -1 3
tastes O -1 3
better. O -1 3

I O -1 3
ordered O -1 3
tamarind O -1 3

and O -1 3
my O -1 3
wife O -1 3
ordered O -1 3
noodles B-ASP 2 3
with I-ASP 2 3
ground I-ASP 2 3
beef, I-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
we O -1 3
were O -1 3
both O -1 3
delighted O -1 3
by O -1 3
the O -1 3
way O -1 3
the O -1 3
dishes O -1 3
evoked O -1 3
Thai O -1 3
flavors O -1 3
in O -1 3
unexpected O -1 3
ways. O -1 3

It O -1 3
is O -1 3
a O -1 3
lot O -1 3
of O -1 3
fun O -1 3
with O -1 3
live O -1 3

We O -1 3

like O -1 3
to O -1 3
thank O -1 3
Marcelo O -1 3
and O -1 3
Grace O -1 3
for O -1 3
a O -1 3
wonderful O -1 3

experience!!! O -1 3

For O -1 3
appetizers, O -1 3
I O -1 3
recommend O -1 3
the O -1 3
shrimp O -1 3
fritters O -1 3
and O -1 3
dumplings. B-ASP 2 3

The O -1 2
food B-ASP 3 2
is O -1 2
expensive, O -1 2
but O -1 2
worth O -1 2
every O -1 2
bite. O -1 2

We O -1 3
made O -1 3
early O -1 3
dinner O -1 3
reservations O -1 3
and O -1 3
were O -1 3
thoroughly O -1 3
impressed, O -1 3

me O -1 3
of O -1 3
my O -1 3

not O -1 3
good O -1 3
considering O -1 3
the O -1 3

was O -1 3
nearly O -1 3
$100(2). O -1 3

The O -1 3

is O -1 3
great(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3

The O -1 3
entertainment O -1 3
was O -1 3
great(1) O -1 3
they O -1 3
have O -1 3
shows O -1 3
that O -1 3
go O -1 3

After O -1 1
2 O -1 1
tries O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiter O -1 1
to O -1 1
take O -1 1
it O -1 1
away O -1 1
(we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
it O -1 1
yet, O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
full O -1 1
beers B-ASP 1 1
yet O -1 1
to O -1 1
drink), O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager O -1 1
approached O -1 1
and O -1 1
told O -1 1
us O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
for O -1 1
people O -1 1
with O -1 1
reservations. O -1 1

I O -1 3
just O -1 3
wonder O -1 3
how O -1 3
you O -1 3
can O -1 3
have O -1 3
such O -1 3
a O -1 3
delicious O -1 3
meal B-ASP 2 3
for O -1 3
such O -1 3
little O -1 3
money. O -1 3

Service O -1 3
is O -1 3
friendly(1), O -1 3
prices O -1 3
are O -1 3
good(2) O -1 3
- O -1 3
delivery O -1 3
time O -1 3
was O -1 3
a O -1 3
little O -1 3
slow(3), O -1 3
but O -1 3
for O -1 3
the O -1 3
way O -1 3
this O -1 3
pizza O -1 3
tastes, O -1 3
I'm O -1 3
willing O -1 3
to O -1 3
overlook O -1 3
it(4). O -1 3

The O -1 3
bar O -1 3
is O -1 3
very O -1 3
well O -1 3
stocked O -1 3
with O -1 3
interesting O -1 3
beers B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
well O -1 3
priced O -1 3
wines. O -1 3

The O -1 3
decor B-ASP 3 3
is O -1 3
nice, O -1 3
but O -1 3
more O -1 3
casual O -1 3
than O -1 3
fine O -1 3
dining. O -1 3

Quality(1) O -1 3
ingredients O -1 3
preparation O -1 3
all O -1 3
around, O -1 3
and O -1 3
a O -1 3
very O -1 3
fair(2) O -1 3
price O -1 3
for O -1 3
NYC. O -1 3

Not O -1 3
only O -1 3
did O -1 3
they O -1 3
have O -1 3
amazing(1), O -1 3
sandwiches, O -1 3
soup, O -1 3
pizza O -1 3
etc, O -1 3
but O -1 3
their O -1 3
homemade O -1 3
sorbets O -1 3
are O -1 3
out O -1 3
of O -1 3
this O -1 3
world(2)! O -1 3

However, O -1 3
I O -1 3
think O -1 3
this O -1 3
place O -1 3
is O -1 3
a O -1 3
good O -1 3
hang O -1 3
out O -1 3
spot. B-ASP 2 3

By O -1 3
far, O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
pizza B-ASP 2 3
in O -1 3
Manhattan. O -1 3

The O -1 1
hot O -1 1

were O -1 1
cold O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
middle O -1 1

the O -1 1

were O -1 1
stale. O -1 1

One O -1 3
thing O -1 3
I O -1 3
liked O -1 3
about O -1 3
this O -1 3
place O -1 3
is O -1 3
that O -1 3
I O -1 3
never O -1 3
felt O -1 3
rushed O -1 3
or O -1 3
pressured O -1 3
to O -1 3
give O -1 3

certain O -1 3

are O -1 3
excellent O -1 3
(the O -1 3
burger, B-ASP 2 3
some O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3

the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
not O -1 3
really O -1 3
the O -1 3
point. O -1 3

The O -1 0
miso O -1 0

lacked O -1 0

the O -1 0

not O -1 0

in O -1 0
the O -1 0
past. O -1 0

We O -1 3
also O -1 3
ordered O -1 3
two O -1 3
hot B-ASP 1 3
dogs I-ASP 1 3
thinking O -1 3
they O -1 3
would O -1 3
be O -1 3
pretty O -1 3
good O -1 3
since O -1 3
there O -1 3
is O -1 3
a O -1 3
whole O -1 3
section O -1 3
on O -1 3
the O -1 3
menu O -1 3
devoted O -1 3
to O -1 3
them. O -1 3

For O -1 3
authentic O -1 3

the O -1 3

the O -1 4

from O -1 4
them O -1 4
just O -1 4
went O -1 4

The O -1 1
only O -1 1

is O -1 1
that O -1 1
the O -1 1

is O -1 1
a O -1 1
complete O -1 1
incompetent. O -1 1

Definite O -1 3

to O -1 3
good O -1 3
Indian B-ASP 2 3

In O -1 3
addition, O -1 3
the O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
very O -1 3
good O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
prices O -1 3
are O -1 3
reasonable. O -1 3

In O -1 3
fact, O -1 3
while O -1 3
leaving O -1 3
the O -1 3
place O -1 3
we O -1 3
saw O -1 3
two O -1 3
people O -1 3
looking O -1 3
at O -1 3
the O -1 3
menu, O -1 3
and O -1 3
I O -1 3
couldn't O -1 3
help O -1 3
telling O -1 3
them O -1 3
that O -1 3
the O -1 3
food B-ASP 0 3
was O -1 3
horrible. O -1 3

The O -1 3
ambiance O -1 3
is O -1 3
minimal(1) O -1 3

some O -1 3

as O -1 3
the O -1 3

tasty. O -1 3

All O -1 3
the O -1 3

are O -1 3
fantastic O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
homemade B-ASP 2 3
lasagna I-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
some O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
that O -1 3
I O -1 3
have O -1 3
had O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3

Some O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0

other O -1 0

We O -1 3
were O -1 3
so O -1 3
happy(1) O -1 3
with O -1 3
our O -1 3
food O -1 3
and O -1 3
were O -1 3
even O -1 3
more O -1 3
thrilled O -1 3
when O -1 3
we O -1 3
saw O -1 3
the(2) O -1 3

like(1) O -1 3
the O -1 3

the O -1 3

but O -1 3
the O -1 3

were O -1 3
kinda O -1 3
dissapointing(2). O -1 3

This O -1 3
is O -1 3
an O -1 3
amazing O -1 3
place O -1 3
to O -1 3
try O -1 3
some O -1 3
roti B-ASP 2 3
rolls. I-ASP 2 3

It O -1 0
took O -1 0
them O -1 0
15 O -1 0
minutes O -1 0
to O -1 0
put O -1 0
water B-ASP 1 0
in O -1 0
our O -1 0
glasses. O -1 0

Not O -1 3
only O -1 3
was O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
outstanding, O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
little O -1 3
'perks' B-ASP 2 3
were O -1 3
great. O -1 3

The O -1 3
sushi B-ASP 0 3
was O -1 3
awful! O -1 3

The O -1 0
man B-ASP 0 0
that O -1 0
was O -1 0
hosting O -1 0
promised O -1 0
to O -1 0
save O -1 0
a O -1 0
table O -1 0
for O -1 0
our O -1 0
party O -1 0
of O -1 0
7, O -1 0
then O -1 0
sat O -1 0
a O -1 0
party O -1 0
of O -1 0
2 O -1 0
at O -1 0
the O -1 0
very O -1 0
table O -1 0
he O -1 0
was O -1 0
saving O -1 0
(mean O -1 0
while O -1 0
there O -1 0
were O -1 0
boths O -1 0
open O -1 0
all O -1 0
around). O -1 0

The O -1 3
pickles B-ASP 2 3
were O -1 3
great O -1 3
addition. O -1 3

I O -1 3
think O -1 3
the O -1 3
stuff B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
better O -1 3
than O -1 3
Disney. O -1 3

And O -1 3
I O -1 3
would O -1 3
have O -1 3
to O -1 3
agree O -1 3
with O -1 3
the O -1 3
masses(1) O -1 3
in O -1 3
terms O -1 3
of O -1 3
service O -1 3
- B-ASP 0 3
delivery O -1 3
is O -1 3
their O -1 3
Achilles' O -1 3
heel(2). O -1 3

The O -1 3
menu B-ASP 2 3
seemed O -1 3
to O -1 3
have O -1 3
a O -1 3
wide O -1 3
variety O -1 3
of O -1 3
dishes O -1 3
for O -1 3
seafood O -1 3
lovers O -1 3
and O -1 3
interesting O -1 3
ways O -1 3
of O -1 3
preparing O -1 3
them. O -1 3

Some O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
workers O -1 0
ignore O -1 0
me O -1 0
and O -1 0
talk O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
female O -1 0
customers, O -1 0
other O -1 0
times, O -1 0
they've O -1 0
skipped O -1 0
my O -1 0
order. B-ASP 0 0

I O -1 3
would O -1 3
not O -1 3
have O -1 3
been O -1 3
so O -1 3
disappointed(1) O -1 3
with O -1 3
the O -1 3
portions O -1 3
if O -1 3
the O -1 3
qualities O -1 3
were O -1 3
good O -1 3
enough O -1 3
to O -1 3
make O -1 3
up O -1 3
for O -1 3
it, O -1 3
but O -1 3
they O -1 3
were O -1 3
not(2)! O -1 3

Forget O -1 3
the(1) O -1 3
rush O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
wait O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
noise O -1 3
(which O -1 3
isn't O -1 3
actually O -1 3
that O -1 3
bad(2)), O -1 3
I O -1 3
mean O -1 3
please, O -1 3
who O -1 3
goes O -1 3
to O -1 3
a O -1 3
steakhouse O -1 3
to O -1 3
be O -1 3
coddled O -1 3
and O -1 3
romantic(3)? O -1 3

I O -1 3
highly O -1 3
recommend O -1 3
it O -1 3
for O -1 3
not O -1 3
just O -1 3
its O -1 3
superb(1) O -1 3
cuisine, O -1 3
but O -1 3
also O -1 3
for O -1 3
its O -1 3
friendly(2) O -1 3
owners O -1 3
and O -1 3
staff. O -1 3

I O -1 3
ordered O -1 3
tamarind O -1 3
duck O -1 3
and O -1 3
my O -1 3
wife O -1 3
ordered O -1 3
noodles O -1 3
with O -1 3
ground O -1 3
beef, O -1 3
and O -1 3
we O -1 3
were O -1 3
both O -1 3
delighted O -1 3
by O -1 3
the O -1 3
way O -1 3
the O -1 3
dishes O -1 3
evoked O -1 3
Thai B-ASP 2 3
flavors I-ASP 2 3
in O -1 3
unexpected O -1 3
ways. O -1 3

But O -1 1
that O -1 1
wasn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
icing O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
cake: O -1 1
a O -1 1
tiramisu B-ASP 0 1
that O -1 1
resembled O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
I O -1 1
have O -1 1
ever O -1 1
had. O -1 1

The O -1 3
vibe O -1 3
is O -1 3
very O -1 3
relaxed O -1 3
and O -1 3
cozy(1), O -1 3
service O -1 3

The O -1 5
avocado B-ASP 2 5
salad I-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
a O -1 5
personal O -1 5
fave. O -1 5

It O -1 0
is O -1 0
run O -1 0
by O -1 0
the O -1 0
same O -1 0
Sichuan B-ASP 1 0
chef I-ASP 1 0
who O -1 0
started O -1 0
the O -1 0

a O -1 3

the O -1 3

had O -1 3
everything O -1 3
happy. O -1 3

With O -1 1
the O -1 1
exception O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
lemon O -1 1
salad O -1 1
that O -1 1
had O -1 1
so O -1 1
much O -1 1
pepper B-ASP 0 1
on O -1 1
it O -1 1
that O -1 1
our O -1 1
eyes O -1 1
started O -1 1
watering, O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
here O -1 1
was O -1 1
decent, O -1 1
not O -1 1
great. O -1 1

The O -1 3
lobster O -1 3
sandwich O -1 3
is O -1 3
good O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
spaghetti B-ASP 2 3
with I-ASP 2 3
Scallops I-ASP 2 3
and I-ASP 2 3
Shrimp I-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
great. O -1 3

It's O -1 0
a O -1 0
shame O -1 0
that O -1 0
a O -1 0
nice, O -1 0
convenient O -1 0
place B-ASP 2 0
like O -1 0
the O -1 0
Pink O -1 0
Pony O -1 0
can O -1 0
be O -1 0
so O -1 0
ruined O -1 0
by O -1 0
lousy O -1 0
service. O -1 0

The O -1 5
service B-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
great(1), O -1 5
my O -1 5
soup O -1 5
always O -1 5
arrives O -1 5
nice O -1 5
and O -1 5
hot(2). O -1 5

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
great(1) O -1 3
(big(2) O -1 3
selection, O -1 3
reasonable(3) O -1 3
prices) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
drinks O -1 3
are O -1 3
really O -1 3
good(4). O -1 3

The O -1 3
service O -1 3
is O -1 3
excellent(1), O -1 3
the O -1 3
decor O -1 3
is O -1 3
great(2), O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
delicious(3) O -1 3
and O -1 3
comes O -1 3
in O -1 3
large(4) O -1 3
portions. O -1 3

I O -1 3
have O -1 3
eaten O -1 3
a O -1 3
lot O -1 3
of O -1 3
pizza B-ASP 1 3
here. O -1 3

The O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
below O -1 0
average, O -1 0
the O -1 0
service O -1 0
was O -1 0
pathetic, O -1 0
there O -1 0
was O -1 0
no O -1 0
ambience B-ASP 0 0
at O -1 0
all. O -1 0

I O -1 3
have O -1 3
lived O -1 3
in O -1 3
Japan O -1 3
for O -1 3
7 O -1 3
years O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
taste O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
feel B-ASP 2 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
is O -1 3
like O -1 3
being O -1 3
back O -1 3
in O -1 3
Japan. O -1 3

Not O -1 3
sure O -1 3
where O -1 3
the O -1 3
previous O -1 3
reviewer, O -1 3
lonk, O -1 3
dined, O -1 3
but O -1 3
Saul O -1 3
is O -1 3
in O -1 3
a O -1 3
great O -1 3
neighborhood O -1 3
and O -1 3
has O -1 3
great O -1 3
food! B-ASP 2 3

And O -1 2
at O -1 2
the O -1 2
conclusion O -1 2
of O -1 2
this O -1 2
culinary O -1 2
nightmare O -1 2
the O -1 2
check O -1 2
was O -1 2
given O -1 2
to O -1 2
our O -1 2
table B-ASP 1 2
by O -1 2
knocking O -1 2
over O -1 2
a O -1 2
glass O -1 2
of O -1 2
water. O -1 2

Succulent O -1 3
steaks B-ASP 2 3
cooked O -1 3
precisely O -1 3
to O -1 3
your O -1 3
desired O -1 3
'doneness' O -1 3
accompanied O -1 3
by O -1 3
salads O -1 3
and O -1 3
sides O -1 3
that O -1 3
don't O -1 3
look O -1 3
like O -1 3
leafy O -1 3
road O -1 3
kill. O -1 3

Our O -1 0
first O -1 0
time O -1 0
in O -1 0
New O -1 0
York O -1 0
and O -1 0
we O -1 0
had O -1 0
to O -1 0
try O -1 0
a O -1 0
New B-ASP 1 0
York I-ASP 1 0
Bagel. I-ASP 1 0

one O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
Chicken B-ASP 2 3
Tikka I-ASP 2 3
Masala. I-ASP 2 3

Of O -1 1
course O -1 1
this O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
is O -1 1
lacking, O -1 1
but O -1 1
what O -1 1
do O -1 1
you O -1 1
expect O -1 1
from O -1 1
a O -1 1
24 O -1 1
hour O -1 1
bagel B-ASP 1 1
place O -1 1
anyways? O -1 1

I O -1 3
tend O -1 3
to O -1 3
judge O -1 3
a O -1 3
sushi O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
by O -1 3
its O -1 3
sea B-ASP 2 3
urchin, I-ASP 2 3
which O -1 3
was O -1 3
heavenly O -1 3
at O -1 3
sushi O -1 3
rose. O -1 3

We O -1 2
asked O -1 2
to O -1 2
be O -1 2
moved O -1 2
(which O -1 2
took O -1 2
half O -1 2
an O -1 2
hour), O -1 2
and O -1 2
then O -1 2
were O -1 2
seated O -1 2
in O -1 2
a O -1 2
high O -1 2
traffic O -1 2
area O -1 2
in O -1 2
the O -1 2
back, O -1 2
even O -1 2
though O -1 2
the O -1 2
rest O -1 2
of O -1 2
the O -1 2
room B-ASP 1 2
was O -1 2
practically O -1 2
empty. O -1 2

What O -1 3
is O -1 3
even O -1 3
better, O -1 3
is O -1 3
that O -1 3
the O -1 3
prices B-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
very O -1 3
affordable O -1 3
as O -1 3
well, O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
really O -1 3
good. O -1 3

my O -1 3

are: O -1 3

This O -1 3

Japanese O -1 3
classic O -1 3

I O -1 1
wouldn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
have O -1 1
complained O -1 1
at O -1 1
all O -1 1
if O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
at O -1 1
least O -1 1
tasted O -1 1
good O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
quality O -1 1
of O -1 1
food O -1 1
was O -1 1
crappy, O -1 1
too. O -1 1

The O -1 1
hot B-ASP 0 1
dogs I-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
cold O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
middle O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1

were O -1 1
stale. O -1 1

The O -1 3
Yellowfin O -1 3
Tuna O -1 3
and O -1 3
Calf's B-ASP 2 3
liver I-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
my O -1 3

The O -1 5
steak O -1 5
is O -1 5
good, O -1 5
the O -1 5
fish O -1 5
is O -1 5
good O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
sushi B-ASP 2 5
was O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
great. O -1 5

The O -1 3

was O -1 3
terrific O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
service O -1 3
classy, O -1 3
attentive, O -1 3
without O -1 3
being O -1 3
overbearing. O -1 3

On O -1 3
a O -1 3
hot O -1 3
day O -1 3
it O -1 3
was O -1 3
fabulous O -1 3
to O -1 3
stop O -1 3
in O -1 3
and O -1 3
enjoy O -1 3
lunch. B-ASP 2 3

The O -1 3
environment O -1 3
is O -1 3
romantic, O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
food B-ASP 0 3
is O -1 3
horrible, O -1 3
the O -1 3
service O -1 3
is O -1 3
pathetic, O -1 3
and O -1 3
gabriella O -1 3
lies O -1 3
about O -1 3
everything O -1 3
she O -1 3
could. O -1 3

The O -1 3
anti-pasta B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
excellent, O -1 3
especially O -1 3
the O -1 3
calamari, O -1 3
as O -1 3
were O -1 3
the O -1 3

The O -1 3

except O -1 3
for O -1 3
offering O -1 3
the O -1 3

pretty O -1 5
good, O -1 5

definitely O -1 5
not O -1 5
great. O -1 5

The O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
great O -1 3
and O -1 3
they O -1 3
have O -1 3
a O -1 3
good O -1 3
selecion B-ASP 2 3

I O -1 3
always O -1 3

the O -1 3

the O -1 3

always O -1 3
wonderful(2) O -1 3

the O -1 3

the O -1 3

filets, O -1 0
2 O -1 0
sides, O -1 0
an O -1 0
appetizer O -1 0
and O -1 0
drinks. B-ASP 1 0

The O -1 1
decor B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
really O -1 1
blah, O -1 1
and O -1 1
not O -1 1
at O -1 1
all O -1 1
hip O -1 1
or O -1 1
happening. O -1 1

It O -1 1
costs O -1 1

to O -1 1
turn O -1 1
a O -1 1
regular O -1 1
roll B-ASP 0 1
into O -1 1
an O -1 1
inside-out O -1 1
roll, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
roll O -1 1
more O -1 1
than O -1 1
triples O -1 1
in O -1 1
size, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that's O -1 1
not O -1 1
just O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
rice. O -1 1

I'd O -1 3
highly O -1 3
recommend O -1 3
it O -1 3
for O -1 3
a O -1 3
special O -1 3
occasion O -1 3
-- O -1 3
it O -1 3
provides O -1 3
and O -1 3
intimate(1) O -1 3
setting O -1 3
and O -1 3
nice(2) O -1 3
service. O -1 3

They O -1 5
even O -1 5
have O -1 5
a O -1 5
section O -1 5
in O -1 5
the O -1 5
menu B-ASP 0 5
called O -1 5
American O -1 5
Chinese O -1 5
food! O -1 5

for O -1 3
an O -1 3
appetizer, O -1 3
their O -1 3
calamari B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
a O -1 3
winner. O -1 3

Both O -1 4
times O -1 4
we O -1 4
waited O -1 4
well O -1 4
over O -1 4
a O -1 4
half O -1 4
hour O -1 4
for O -1 4
a O -1 4
table B-ASP 0 4
(even O -1 4
though O -1 4
we O -1 4
had O -1 4
reservations). O -1 4

I O -1 0
had O -1 0
Filet B-ASP 1 0
Mignon I-ASP 1 0
with I-ASP 1 0
garlic I-ASP 1 0
mash. I-ASP 1 0

But O -1 2
the O -1 2
pizza B-ASP 0 2
is O -1 2
way O -1 2
to O -1 2
expensive. O -1 2

Only O -1 3
wine O -1 3
and O -1 3
beer B-ASP 1 3
are O -1 3
served, O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
house O -1 3
varities O -1 3
are O -1 3
actually O -1 3
quite O -1 3
good. O -1 3

I O -1 3
had O -1 3
Lobster B-ASP 2 3
Bisque I-ASP 2 3
it O -1 3
has O -1 3
2 O -1 3
oz. O -1 3
of O -1 3
Maine O -1 3
Lobster O -1 3
in O -1 3
it. O -1 3

Unfortunately, O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 0 5
was O -1 5
NOT O -1 5
something O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
worked O -1 5
up O -1 5
about. O -1 5

Disappointing O -1 0
food, O -1 0
lousy O -1 0
service. B-ASP 0 0

I O -1 3
would O -1 3
highly O -1 3
recommend O -1 3
this O -1 3
place O -1 3
to O -1 3
anyone O -1 3
looking O -1 3
for O -1 3
a O -1 3
casual O -1 3
atmosphere B-ASP 2 3
that O -1 3
whisks O -1 3
you O -1 3
away O -1 3
to O -1 3
the O -1 3
left O -1 3
bank O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3

nice O -1 3
little(2) O -1 3

Francois, O -1 3
and O -1 3
good(4) O -1 3
service. O -1 3

I O -1 1
had O -1 1
their O -1 1
eggs B-ASP 0 1
benedict I-ASP 0 1
for O -1 1
brunch, O -1 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
the O -1 1
worst O -1 1
in O -1 1
my O -1 1
entire O -1 1
life, O -1 1
I O -1 1
tried O -1 1
removing O -1 1
the O -1 1
hollondaise O -1 1
sauce O -1 1
completely O -1 1
that O -1 1
was O -1 1
how O -1 1
failed O -1 1
it O -1 1
was. O -1 1

Delicious O -1 3
crab B-ASP 2 3
cakes I-ASP 2 3
too. O -1 3

I O -1 3
think O -1 3
I've O -1 3
had O -1 3
some O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
meals B-ASP 2 3
of O -1 3
my O -1 3
life O -1 3
at O -1 3
minnow. O -1 3

The O -1 3
service B-ASP 3 3
is O -1 3
a O -1 3
quite O -1 3
slow O -1 3
(1), O -1 3
but O -1 3
friendly(2). O -1 3

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 1 3
is O -1 3
decent O -1 3
at O -1 3
best, O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
ambience, O -1 3
well, O -1 3
it's O -1 3
a O -1 3
matter O -1 3
of O -1 3
opinion, O -1 3
some O -1 3
may O -1 3
consider O -1 3
it O -1 3
to O -1 3
be O -1 3
a O -1 3
sweet O -1 3
thing, O -1 3
I O -1 3
thought O -1 3
it O -1 3
was O -1 3
just O -1 3
annoying. O -1 3

Our O -1 0
waiter O -1 0
was O -1 0
friendly(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
it O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
shame O -1 0
that O -1 0
he O -1 0
didnt O -1 0
have O -1 0
a O -1 0
supportive(2) O -1 0
staff O -1 0
to O -1 0
work O -1 0
with. O -1 0

The O -1 0
main O -1 0
downside O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
place O -1 0
is O -1 0
the O -1 0
nazi-like O -1 0
guy B-ASP 0 0
running O -1 0
it O -1 0
who O -1 0
constantly O -1 0
complains O -1 0
about O -1 0
the O -1 0
noise O -1 0
level. O -1 0

Example O -1 5
is O -1 5
the O -1 5
soup O -1 5
which O -1 5
was O -1 5
about O -1 5
6 O -1 5
oz O -1 5
for O -1 5
$12 O -1 5
dollars O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
mushrooms B-ASP 2 5
where O -1 5
$12 O -1 5
for O -1 5
about O -1 5
1oz. O -1 5

The O -1 0
service O -1 0
is O -1 0
descent(1) O -1 0
even O -1 0
when O -1 0
this O -1 0
small O -1 0
place O -1 0
is O -1 0
packed(2). O -1 0

They O -1 3
have O -1 3
wheat B-ASP 2 3
crusted I-ASP 2 3
pizza I-ASP 2 3
made O -1 3
with O -1 3
really O -1 3
fresh(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
yummy(2) O -1 3
ingredients. O -1 3

A O -1 3
The O -1 3
service O -1 3
was O -1 3
good O -1 3
to O -1 3
excellent O -1 3
along O -1 3
with O -1 3
the O -1 3
attitude. O -1 3

The O -1 1
rice O -1 1
was O -1 1
poor O -1 1
quality B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
was O -1 1
cooked O -1 1
so O -1 1
badly O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
hard. O -1 1

You O -1 0
should O -1 0
pass O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
calamari. B-ASP 0 0

The O -1 3
steak B-ASP 2 3
melted O -1 3
in O -1 3
my O -1 3
mouth. O -1 3

The O -1 0
red O -1 0
curry O -1 0
is O -1 0
weak O -1 0
and O -1 0
tasteless(1), O -1 0
the O -1 0
pad I-ASP 0 0
thai O -1 0
is O -1 0
stuck O -1 0
together O -1 0
and O -1 0
lumpy(2), O -1 0
the O -1 0
rice O -1 0
is O -1 0
often O -1 0
overcooked(3), O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
seafood O -1 0
is O -1 0
pretty O -1 0
sketchy(4). O -1 0

The O -1 0
price B-ASP 2 0
is O -1 0
reasonable O -1 0
although O -1 0
the O -1 0
service O -1 0
is O -1 0
poor. O -1 0

The O -1 3
bread B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
lamb O -1 3
chops O -1 3
I O -1 3
had O -1 3
before O -1 3
the O -1 3
meal O -1 3
were O -1 3
quite O -1 3
good, O -1 3
however. O -1 3

The O -1 3
chicken O -1 3
and O -1 3
steak B-ASP 2 3
were O -1 3
seasoned O -1 3
and O -1 3
cooked O -1 3
to O -1 3
perfection(1), O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
lamb O -1 3

if O -1 0
it's O -1 0

you O -1 0

Besides O -1 1

My O -1 3

ordered O -1 3
some O -1 3
of O -1 3
their O -1 3
special O -1 3
sushi B-ASP 2 3

which O -1 3
had O -1 3
excellent O -1 3
presentation O -1 3
and O -1 3
tasted O -1 3
great! O -1 3

We've O -1 3
always O -1 3
gotten O -1 3
amazing(1) O -1 3
service O -1 3
and O -1 3
we O -1 3
love(2) O -1 3
the O -1 3

fine O -1 3

All O -1 3
the O -1 3
pastas B-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
fantastic O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
homemade O -1 3
lasagna O -1 3
is O -1 3
some O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
that O -1 3
I O -1 3
have O -1 3
had O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
City. O -1 3

The O -1 0
staff B-ASP 0 0
should O -1 0
be O -1 0
a O -1 0
bit O -1 0
more O -1 0

While O -1 3
this O -1 3
can O -1 3
hardly O -1 3
be O -1 3
called O -1 3
a O -1 3
restaurant, O -1 3
it O -1 3
is O -1 3
possibly O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3

in O -1 3
Manhatten: O -1 3

at O -1 0
a O -1 0
glorified O -1 0

clumsy O -1 0
service, B-ASP 0 0
and O -1 0
management O -1 0
that O -1 0
doesn't O -1 0

us, O -1 0
we've O -1 0
been O -1 0
eating O -1 0
sushi B-ASP 1 0
for O -1 0
over O -1 0
15 O -1 0
yrs. O -1 0

Service B-ASP 3 3
was O -1 3
very O -1 3
prompt O -1 3
but O -1 3
slightly O -1 3
rushed. O -1 3

All O -1 0
the O -1 0
food B-ASP 2 0
was O -1 0
hot O -1 0
tasty. O -1 0

Both O -1 2
times O -1 2
I O -1 2
was O -1 2
extremely O -1 2
dissappointed O -1 2
by O -1 2
the O -1 2
service, B-ASP 0 2
which O -1 2
was O -1 2
boarderline O -1 2
rude. O -1 2

The O -1 4
pizza B-ASP 0 4
is O -1 4
overpriced O -1 4
and O -1 4
soggy. O -1 4

Waiters B-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
very O -1 3
friendly(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
pasta O -1 3
is O -1 3
out O -1 3
of O -1 3
this O -1 3
world(2). O -1 3

They O -1 0
couldn't O -1 0
even O -1 0
make O -1 0
a O -1 0
salad B-ASP 0 0
that O -1 0
was O -1 0
appealing. O -1 0

Just O -1 2
bring O -1 2
someone O -1 2
who O -1 2
speaks O -1 2
Cantonese O -1 2
because O -1 2
waiter B-ASP 0 2
may O -1 2
not O -1 2
understand O -1 2
you. O -1 2

The O -1 0
staff B-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0
arrogant(1), O -1 0
the O -1 0
prices O -1 0
are O -1 0
way O -1 0
high O -1 0
for O -1 0
Brooklyn(2). O -1 0

The O -1 0
hostess B-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0
rude O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
point O -1 0
of O -1 0
being O -1 0
offensive. O -1 0

The O -1 5
food O -1 5
was O -1 5
definitely O -1 5
good(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
when O -1 5
all O -1 5
was O -1 5
said O -1 5
and O -1 5
done, O -1 5
I O -1 5
just O -1 5
couldn't O -1 5
justify O -1 5
it(2) O -1 5
for O -1 5
the I-ASP 0 5
price O -1 5
(including O -1 5
2 O -1 5
drinks, O -1 5
$100/person)... O -1 5

the O -1 0
real O -1 0
kicker O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
menu, B-ASP 1 0
however, O -1 0
is O -1 0
the O -1 0
beef O -1 0
cubes O -1 0
or O -1 0
the O -1 0
chicken O -1 0
with O -1 0
chili O -1 0
and O -1 0
lemon O -1 0
grass. O -1 0

I've O -1 2
waited O -1 2
over O -1 2
one O -1 2
hour O -1 2
for O -1 2
food. B-ASP 1 2

If O -1 3
you're O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
neighborhood, O -1 3
definitely O -1 3
stop O -1 3
by O -1 3
for O -1 3
a O -1 3
great O -1 3
meal. B-ASP 2 3

but, O -1 3
the O -1 3
filet O -1 3
mignon O -1 3
was O -1 3
not O -1 3
very O -1 3
good(1) O -1 3
at O -1 3
all O -1 3
cocktail O -1 3
hour O -1 3
includes O -1 3
free O -1 3
appetizers O -1 3
(nice(2) O -1 3
non-sushi I-ASP 2 3
selection). O -1 3

The O -1 3
guac O -1 3
is O -1 3
fresh(1), O -1 3
yet O -1 3
lacking(2) O -1 3
flavor, O -1 3
we O -1 3
like O -1 3
to O -1 3
add O -1 3
our(3) O -1 3
fresh O -1 3
salsa O -1 3
into O -1 3
it. O -1 3

Probably O -1 0
my O -1 0
worst(1) O -1 0
dining O -1 0
experience O -1 0
in O -1 0
new O -1 0
york, O -1 0
and O -1 0
I'm O -1 0
a O -1 0
former(2) O -1 0

I O -1 0
know O -1 0
what O -1 0
I'm O -1 0

about. O -1 0

you O -1 0

easily, O -1 0
you O -1 0
will O -1 0
find O -1 0

that O -1 0

The O -1 3
main O -1 3
draw O -1 3
of O -1 3
this O -1 3
place O -1 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
price. B-ASP 2 3

I'm O -1 3
no O -1 3
food B-ASP 1 3
critic, O -1 3
but O -1 3
I'd O -1 3
like O -1 3
to O -1 3
think O -1 3
I O -1 3
have O -1 3
a O -1 3
tiny O -1 3
bit O -1 3
of O -1 3
experience O -1 3
under O -1 3
my O -1 3

lived O -1 3
in O -1 3
NY O -1 3
for O -1 3
the O -1 3
last O -1 3
11 O -1 3

staff B-ASP 2 3
greeted O -1 3
me O -1 3
warmly O -1 3
at O -1 3
the O -1 3

I O -1 3
was O -1 3
seated O -1 3
promptly O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
excellent(2). O -1 3

The O -1 3

was O -1 3
extremely O -1 3

The O -1 3

The O -1 3
service B-ASP 3 3
was O -1 3
attentive, O -1 3
yet O -1 3
unimposing(1), O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
far O -1 3
better O -1 3
than O -1 3
many O -1 3
notorious O -1 3
restaurants O -1 3

price B-ASP 0 5
you O -1 5
pay O -1 5
for O -1 5

a O -1 3

probably O -1 3
be O -1 3
best(2). O -1 3

those O -1 2

This O -1 2
particular O -1 2
location O -1 2
certainly O -1 2
uses O -1 2
substandard O -1 2

The O -1 3

so O -1 3
good O -1 3
and O -1 3
so O -1 3
popular(1) O -1 3

Overall O -1 3
the O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
is O -1 3
more O -1 3
expensive O -1 3
than O -1 3
our O -1 3
other O -1 3
sushi B-ASP 1 3
favorites, O -1 3
but O -1 3
everything O -1 3
was O -1 3
delicious. O -1 3

Not O -1 3
a O -1 3
large O -1 3
place, B-ASP 3 3
but O -1 3
it's O -1 3
cute O -1 3
and O -1 3
cozy. O -1 3

Their O -1 3
sake B-ASP 2 3
list I-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
extensive(1), O -1 3
but O -1 3
we O -1 3
were O -1 3
looking O -1 3

I O -1 3

Scallion B-ASP 2 3
Pancake I-ASP 2 3

I O -1 3
wouldn't O -1 3
recommend O -1 3
to O -1 3
my O -1 3
American O -1 3
friends O -1 3
as O -1 3
it's O -1 3
very O -1 3
spicy. O -1 3

it O -1 3
is O -1 3
a O -1 3
cozy O -1 3
place B-ASP 2 3
to O -1 3
go O -1 3
with O -1 3
a O -1 3
couple O -1 3
of O -1 3
friends. O -1 3

I've O -1 3
been O -1 3
to O -1 3
this O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
more O -1 3
than O -1 3
a O -1 3
dozen O -1 3
times O -1 3
and O -1 3
when O -1 3
I'm O -1 3
craving(1) O -1 3
for O -1 3
Pho, O -1 3
Lemon O -1 3
grass O -1 3
chicken O -1 3
or O -1 3
Beef O -1 3
Cube O -1 3
on O -1 3
rice, O -1 3
this O -1 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
place O -1 3
to O -1 3
go(2). O -1 3

The O -1 3
Sashimi B-ASP 2 3
portion I-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
big O -1 3
enough O -1 3
to O -1 3
appease O -1 3
most O -1 3
people(1), O -1 3
but O -1 3
I O -1 3
didn't O -1 3
like O -1 3
the O -1 3
fact(2) O -1 3
they O -1 3
used O -1 3
artifical O -1 3
lobster O -1 3
meat. O -1 3

Because O -1 3
we O -1 3
didn't O -1 3
have O -1 3
a O -1 3
reservation, O -1 3
we O -1 3
could O -1 3
only O -1 3
sit O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
back B-ASP 2 3
garden, I-ASP 2 3
but O -1 3
it O -1 3
was O -1 3
great, O -1 3
secluded O -1 3
and O -1 3
perfect O -1 3
in O -1 3
nice O -1 3
weather. O -1 3

The O -1 3
bread B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
soft(1) O -1 3
paratha O -1 3
bread O -1 3
(unlike O -1 3
the O -1 3
plain(2) O -1 3
bread O -1 3
they O -1 3
use O -1 3
in O -1 3
Calcutta), O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
stuffing O -1 3
is O -1 3
tandoori O -1 3
styled O -1 3
and O -1 3
very O -1 3
flavorful(3). O -1 3

The O -1 3
location O -1 3
and O -1 3
ambience B-ASP 1 3
is O -1 3
Ok O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
what O -1 3
makes O -1 3
up O -1 3
for O -1 3
it. O -1 3

Traditional B-ASP 2 3
French I-ASP 2 3
decour I-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
pleasant(1) O -1 3
though O -1 3
the O -1 3
hall O -1 3
was O -1 3
rather O -1 3
noisy O -1 3
- O -1 3
the O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
was O -1 3
full O -1 3
and O -1 3
we O -1 3
had O -1 3
to O -1 3
raise O -1 3
our O -1 3
voices O -1 3
to O -1 3
be O -1 3
able O -1 3
to O -1 3
maintain O -1 3
a O -1 3
conversation(2). O -1 3

Bill B-ASP 3 3
a O -1 3
little O -1 3
high, O -1 3
but O -1 3
worth O -1 3
it. O -1 3

The O -1 1
scallion O -1 1
pancakes O -1 1
and O -1 1
fried B-ASP 1 1
dumplings I-ASP 1 1
were O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
out O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
ordinary. O -1 1

But O -1 0
the O -1 0
staff B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
so O -1 0
horrible O -1 0
to O -1 0
us. O -1 0

Had O -1 3
a O -1 3
great O -1 3
experience(1) O -1 3
at O -1 3
Trio O -1 3
... O -1 3
staff O -1 3
was O -1 3
pleasant(2); O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
tasty O -1 3
and O -1 3
large(2) O -1 3
in O -1 3
portion O -1 3
size O -1 3
- O -1 3
I O -1 3
would O -1 3
highly O -1 3
recommend(4) O -1 3
the O -1 3
portobello/gorgonzola/sausage O -1 3
appetizer O -1 3
and I-ASP 2 3
the I-ASP 2 3
lobster O -1 3
risotto. O -1 3

So, O -1 3
the O -1 3
menu B-ASP 1 3
is O -1 3
written O -1 3
in O -1 3
chalk O -1 3
above O -1 3
your O -1 3
head O -1 3
and O -1 3
it O -1 3
all O -1 3
sounds O -1 3
delicious. O -1 3

However, O -1 3
if O -1 3
you O -1 3
want O -1 3
great(1) O -1 3
food O -1 3
at O -1 3
a O -1 3
great(2) O -1 3
price O -1 3
and O -1 3
don't O -1 3
mind O -1 3
the(3) O -1 3
decor, O -1 3
you O -1 3
can't O -1 3
beat O -1 3
this O -1 3
place. O -1 3

We O -1 3
had O -1 3
tons O -1 3
of O -1 3
great(1) O -1 3
food, O -1 3
wine, O -1 3
and O -1 3
desserts. O -1 3

However, O -1 3
service B-ASP 1 3
was O -1 3
as O -1 3
plain O -1 3
as O -1 3
sesame O -1 3
crusted O -1 3
Salmon O -1 3
I O -1 3
had. O -1 3

Generously O -1 3
garnished(1), O -1 3
organic O -1 3
grilled O -1 3
burgers O -1 3
are O -1 3
the O -1 3
most O -1 3
popular(2) O -1 3
dish, O -1 3
but O -1 3
the I-ASP 2 3
Jerusalem I-ASP 2 3
market-style I-ASP 2 3
falafel I-ASP 2 3
wraps O -1 3
and O -1 3
Mediterranean O -1 3
salads--layered O -1 3
with O -1 3
beets, O -1 3
goat O -1 3
cheese O -1 3
and O -1 3
walnuts--are O -1 3
equally O -1 3
scrumptious(3). O -1 3

Try O -1 0
the O -1 0
tandoori B-ASP 2 0
salmon! I-ASP 2 0

The O -1 3
service O -1 3
was O -1 3
fast O -1 3
and O -1 3
friendly O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
very O -1 3
tasty O -1 3
and O -1 3
they O -1 3
had O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
hot O -1 3
sauce O -1 3
to O -1 3
add O -1 3
to O -1 3
your O -1 3
meals. O -1 3

The O -1 3
bartenders B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
managers O -1 3
are O -1 3
really O -1 3
nice(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
decor O -1 3
is O -1 3
very O -1 3
comfy O -1 3
and O -1 3
laid-back(2), O -1 3
all O -1 3
the O -1 3
while O -1 3
being O -1 3
trendy. O -1 3

I O -1 3
had O -1 3
a O -1 3
terrific O -1 3
meal, O -1 3
and O -1 3
our O -1 3
server O -1 3
guided O -1 3
us O -1 3
toward O -1 3
a O -1 3
very O -1 3
nice O -1 3
wine B-ASP 2 3
in O -1 3
our O -1 3
price O -1 3
range, O -1 3
instead O -1 3
of O -1 3
allowing O -1 3
us O -1 3
to O -1 3
purchase O -1 3
a O -1 3
similarly O -1 3
priced O -1 3
wine O -1 3
that O -1 3
wasn't O -1 3
as O -1 3
good. O -1 3

Their O -1 3
exotic B-ASP 2 3
salad I-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
basic O -1 3
ly O -1 3
a O -1 3
delcious(1) O -1 3

I O -1 3

up O -1 3

and O -1 3
it O -1 3

place; O -1 3
also, O -1 3

the O -1 3

was O -1 3
better O -1 3

what O -1 3

it O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1

a O -1 1

that O -1 1

something O -1 1

While O -1 3
the O -1 3

were O -1 3
great, O -1 3
the O -1 3

could O -1 3
have O -1 3
been O -1 3
a O -1 3

After O -1 0
I O -1 0
paid O -1 0
for O -1 0
my O -1 0

I O -1 0
noticed O -1 0
they O -1 0
had O -1 0
not O -1 0
given O -1 0
me(1) O -1 0

so O -1 0
I O -1 0
could O -1 0
eat(2) O -1 0
my O -1 0

I O -1 3
had O -1 3
a O -1 3
terrific O -1 3
meal, O -1 3
and O -1 3
our O -1 3
server O -1 3
guided O -1 3
us O -1 3
toward O -1 3
a O -1 3
very O -1 3
nice O -1 3
wine O -1 3
in O -1 3
our O -1 3
price B-ASP 2 3
range, O -1 3
instead O -1 3
of O -1 3
allowing O -1 3
us O -1 3
to O -1 3
purchase O -1 3
a O -1 3
similarly O -1 3
priced O -1 3
wine O -1 3
that O -1 3
wasn't O -1 3
as O -1 3
good. O -1 3

The O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
great(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
service O -1 3
was O -1 3
even O -1 3
better(2). O -1 3

For O -1 2
some O -1 2
reason, O -1 2
all O -1 2
the O -1 2
seafood O -1 2
on O -1 2
the O -1 2
menu O -1 2
was O -1 2
unavailable O -1 2
except O -1 2
for O -1 2
the O -1 2

I O -1 3
really O -1 3

The O -1 3
ambiance O -1 3
is O -1 3
minimal(1) O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
not O -1 3
phenomenal(2), O -1 3
but O -1 3
some O -1 3
dishes O -1 3
are O -1 3
quite O -1 3
good(3), O -1 3
such O -1 3
as O -1 3
the O -1 3

And O -1 3
it O -1 3
all O -1 3
comes O -1 3
at O -1 3
a O -1 3
very O -1 3
reasonable O -1 3

(congee, B-ASP 1 3

The O -1 3

is O -1 3
perfect. O -1 3

The O -1 3

is O -1 3
amazing, O -1 3
there's O -1 3

some O -1 3

This O -1 3

the O -1 3

the O -1 3

is O -1 0

more O -1 0

we O -1 0
greatly O -1 0
enjoyed O -1 0
the O -1 0

Our O -1 3

The O -1 3

to O -1 3
do... O -1 3

The O -1 3

was O -1 3
nice O -1 3
and O -1 3
calm. O -1 3

The O -1 3
staff O -1 3
is O -1 3
very O -1 3
attentive O -1 3

we O -1 3

the O -1 3
fact O -1 3
that O -1 3
the O -1 3

The O -1 1
food O -1 1
was O -1 1
mediocre O -1 1
at O -1 1
best O -1 1
but O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
horrible O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
that O -1 1
made O -1 1
me O -1 1

even O -1 1
let O -1 1
me O -1 1
start O -1 1
with O -1 1
how O -1 1

each O -1 3

being O -1 3
better O -1 3
than O -1 3
the O -1 3

The O -1 3

in O -1 3
that O -1 3

at O -1 3
those O -1 3

a O -1 3

should O -1 3
be O -1 3

We O -1 5
ordered O -1 5

the O -1 3

kinda O -1 3
dissapointing(2). O -1 3

I O -1 3
was O -1 3
starving O -1 3

the O -1 3

crazy! O -1 3

were O -1 1
the O -1 1
worst O -1 1
in O -1 1
my O -1 1
entire O -1 1

I O -1 1
tried O -1 1

completely O -1 1
that O -1 1

more O -1 3
popular O -1 3
as(1) O -1 3
a I-ASP 2 3

with O -1 3
only O -1 3

I O -1 0
mention O -1 0
the O -1 0
wine? B-ASP 1 0

The O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
good(1), O -1 3
the O -1 3
teriyaki O -1 3
I O -1 3
recommend(2). O -1 3

The O -1 3
food--though O -1 3
mostly O -1 3
deep-fried--is O -1 3
simple O -1 3
and O -1 3
satisfying. O -1 3

To O -1 3
the O -1 3
owners; B-ASP 2 3
good O -1 3
job O -1 3
guys, O -1 3
this O -1 3
place O -1 3
is O -1 3
a O -1 3
keeper! O -1 3

I O -1 5
asked O -1 5
for O -1 5
an O -1 5
open B-ASP 1 5
faced I-ASP 1 5
cheese I-ASP 1 5
sandwich I-ASP 1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
manager O -1 5
basically O -1 5
told O -1 5
me O -1 5
to O -1 5
take O -1 5
my O -1 5
business O -1 5
elsewhere! O -1 5

After O -1 3
really O -1 3
enjoying O -1 3
ourselves O -1 3
at O -1 3
the O -1 3
bar O -1 3
we O -1 3
sat O -1 3
down O -1 3
at O -1 3
a O -1 3
table O -1 3
and O -1 3
had O -1 3
dinner. B-ASP 1 3

instead O -1 2
ordered O -1 2
an O -1 2
ice O -1 2
cold O -1 2
beer B-ASP 2 2
which O -1 2
to O -1 2
me O -1 2
works O -1 2
with O -1 2
indian. O -1 2

Service B-ASP 0 3
was O -1 3
slow(1), O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
people O -1 3
were O -1 3
friendly(2). O -1 3

The O -1 0
red O -1 0
curry O -1 0
is O -1 0
weak O -1 0
and O -1 0
tasteless(1), O -1 0
the O -1 0
pad O -1 0
thai O -1 0
is O -1 0
stuck O -1 0
together O -1 0
and O -1 0
lumpy(2), O -1 0
the O -1 0
rice O -1 0
is O -1 0
often O -1 0
overcooked(3), O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
seafood O -1 0
is O -1 0
pretty O -1 0
sketchy(4). O -1 0

The O -1 5
unattractive(1) O -1 5
lighting O -1 5
made O -1 5
me O -1 5
want O -1 5
to O -1 5
gag, O -1 5
the O -1 5
food O -1 5
was O -1 5
overpriced(2), O -1 5
there O -1 5
was O -1 5
the O -1 5
most O -1 5
awful(3) O -1 5
disco O -1 5
pop O -1 5
duo O -1 5
performing-and O -1 5
my O -1 5
escargot O -1 5
looked O -1 5
like O -1 5
it O -1 5
might O -1 5
crawl O -1 5
off O -1 5
the O -1 5
plate(4). O -1 5

BTW, O -1 3
the O -1 3
service B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
very O -1 3
good. O -1 3

What O -1 3
an O -1 3
amazing O -1 3
meal B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
experience! O -1 3

I O -1 3
highly O -1 3
recommend O -1 3
it O -1 3
for O -1 3
not O -1 3
just O -1 3
its O -1 3
superb(1) O -1 3
cuisine, O -1 3
but O -1 3
also O -1 3
for O -1 3
its O -1 3
friendly(2) O -1 3
owners O -1 3
and I-ASP 2 3
staff. O -1 3

The O -1 3
staff O -1 3
is O -1 3
very O -1 3
kind(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
well O -1 3
trained, O -1 3
they're O -1 3
fast, O -1 3
they O -1 3
are O -1 3
always O -1 3
prompt O -1 3
to O -1 3
jump O -1 3
behind O -1 3
the(2) O -1 3
bar O -1 3
and O -1 3
fix O -1 3

they O -1 3
know O -1 3
details O -1 3
of O -1 3
every O -1 3
item O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
menu O -1 3
and O -1 3
make O -1 3
excelent O -1 3
recomendations(3). O -1 3

We O -1 3
a O -1 3
menu O -1 3
that O -1 3
rearely O -1 3
changes(1),e O -1 3
xcept O -1 3
for O -1 3
one O -1 3

the O -1 3

and O -1 3
care O -1 3
they O -1 3
put O -1 3
in O -1 3
thier O -1 3
food O -1 3
in O -1 3
evident(2). O -1 3

Just O -1 0
because O -1 0
it's O -1 0
cheap O -1 0
does O -1 0
NOT O -1 0
mean O -1 0
the O -1 0
portions B-ASP 2 0
are O -1 0
small(1) O -1 0
or O -1 0
the O -1 0
food O -1 0
is O -1 0
nasty, O -1 0
IT O -1 0
IS O -1 0
GREAT(2)! O -1 0

For O -1 3
dinner O -1 3
I O -1 3
had O -1 3
the O -1 3
chicken O -1 3
tikka-masala O -1 3
and O -1 3
some O -1 3
garlic B-ASP 1 3
naan. I-ASP 1 3

We O -1 3
have O -1 3
never O -1 3
had O -1 3
any O -1 3
problems O -1 3
with O -1 3
charging O -1 3
the O -1 3
meal O -1 3
or O -1 3
the O -1 3
tip, B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
delivered O -1 3
quickly, O -1 3
but O -1 3
we O -1 3
live O -1 3
only O -1 3
a O -1 3
few O -1 3
minutes O -1 3
walk O -1 3
from O -1 3
them. O -1 3

overall, O -1 0
a O -1 0
solid O -1 0
restaurant O -1 0
and O -1 0
at O -1 0
less O -1 0
than O -1 0
$40pp O -1 0
(including O -1 0
wine), B-ASP 1 0
a O -1 0
solid O -1 0
deal O -1 0
as O -1 0
well. O -1 0

I O -1 3
found O -1 3
the O -1 3
food, O -1 3
service B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
value O -1 3
exceptional O -1 3
everytime O -1 3
I O -1 3
have O -1 3
been O -1 3
there. O -1 3

The O -1 0
service, O -1 0
however, O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
peg O -1 0
or O -1 0
two O -1 0
below(1) O -1 0
the O -1 0
quality O -1 0
of O -1 0

and O -1 0
the O -1 0
clientele, O -1 0
for O -1 0
the O -1 0
most O -1 0
part, O -1 0
are O -1 0
rowdy, O -1 0
loud-mouthed O -1 0
commuters O -1 0
(this O -1 0
could O -1 0
explain O -1 0
the O -1 0
bad O -1 0
attitudes(3) O -1 0
from O -1 0

Unfortunately, O -1 3
the O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
outstanding, O -1 3
but O -1 3
everything O -1 3
else O -1 3
about O -1 3
this O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
pits. O -1 3

I O -1 3
went O -1 3
to O -1 3
Common O -1 3
Stock O -1 3
for O -1 3
brunch B-ASP 1 3
and O -1 3
I O -1 3
was O -1 3
so O -1 3
impressed. O -1 3

To O -1 0
begin, O -1 0
we O -1 0
were O -1 0
told O -1 0
there O -1 0
was O -1 0
a O -1 0
30 O -1 0
minute O -1 0
wait O -1 0
and O -1 0
started O -1 0
to O -1 0
leave, O -1 0
when O -1 0
the O -1 0
hostess O -1 0
offered O -1 0
to O -1 0
call O -1 0
us O -1 0
on O -1 0
our O -1 0
cell O -1 0
phone O -1 0
when O -1 0
the O -1 0
table B-ASP 2 0
was O -1 0
ready. O -1 0

The O -1 3
ceiling B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
amazing! O -1 3

The O -1 0
french B-ASP 2 0
fries I-ASP 2 0
-- B-ASP 2 0
with I-ASP 2 0
the I-ASP 2 0
kalmata I-ASP 2 0

were O -1 0
terrific! O -1 0

They O -1 3
have O -1 3
an O -1 3
excellent(2) O -1 3
selection O -1 3
(the O -1 3
rolls I-ASP 2 3
with I-ASP 2 3
crab O -1 3
are O -1 3
really O -1 3
great(2)). O -1 3

The O -1 0
food B-ASP 1 0
did O -1 0
take O -1 0
a O -1 0
few O -1 0
extra O -1 0
minutes O -1 0
to O -1 0
come(1), O -1 0
but O -1 0
the O -1 0
cute O -1 0
waiters' O -1 0
jokes O -1 0
and O -1 0
friendliness O -1 0
made O -1 0
up O -1 0
for O -1 0
it(2). O -1 0

The O -1 3
prices O -1 3
cannot O -1 3
be O -1 3
beat O -1 3
for O -1 3
the O -1 3
quality, O -1 3
quantity, B-ASP 2 3
freshness O -1 3
and O -1 3
taste. O -1 3

BUt O -1 3
their O -1 3
best O -1 3
dish O -1 3
is O -1 3
thh O -1 3
Thai O -1 3
spiced O -1 3
curry O -1 3
noodles O -1 3
with O -1 3
shrimp O -1 3
- O -1 3
a O -1 3
dish O -1 3
that O -1 3
would O -1 3
cost B-ASP 2 3
$23.95 O -1 3
is O -1 3
most O -1 3
places, O -1 3
but O -1 3
it O -1 3
is O -1 3
$16 O -1 3
here. O -1 3

The O -1 3
highlight O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
night(1) O -1 3
was O -1 3
the O -1 3
mayonaisse O -1 3
for O -1 3
my O -1 3
side O -1 3
of O -1 3
fries O -1 3
I O -1 3
received O -1 3
from O -1 3
one O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
food I-ASP 1 3
runners, O -1 3
which O -1 3
is O -1 3
not O -1 3
good O -1 3
considering O -1 3
the O -1 3
bill O -1 3
was O -1 3
nearly O -1 3
$100(2). O -1 3

Guacamole?? O -1 3
appetizer O -1 3
was O -1 3
really O -1 3
great, O -1 3
we O -1 3
both O -1 3
had O -1 3
the O -1 3
filet, O -1 3
very O -1 3
good, O -1 3
didn't O -1 3
much O -1 3
like O -1 3
the O -1 3
frites O -1 3
that O -1 3
came O -1 3
with, O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
filet O -1 3
was I-ASP 2 3
so O -1 3
good, O -1 3
neither O -1 3
of O -1 3
us O -1 3
cared. O -1 3

They O -1 3
are O -1 3
served B-ASP 1 3
on O -1 3
Focacchia O -1 3
bread O -1 3
and O -1 3
are O -1 3
to O -1 3
die O -1 3
for. O -1 3

Great O -1 3
sushi B-ASP 2 3
experience. O -1 3

I O -1 3
loved O -1 3
everythig O -1 3
about O -1 3
it-especially O -1 3
the O -1 3
shows O -1 3
and O -1 3
actors. B-ASP 2 3

My O -1 3
friends O -1 3
and O -1 3
I O -1 3
experienced O -1 3
amazing O -1 3

delicious, O -1 3
new O -1 3
summer O -1 3
menu B-ASP 2 3
at O -1 3
Artisanal O -1 3
last O -1 3
night. O -1 3

Anyway, O -1 3
the O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
good, O -1 3
the O -1 3
price O -1 3
is O -1 3
right O -1 3
and O -1 3
they O -1 3
have O -1 3
a O -1 3
decent O -1 3
wine O -1 3
list. O -1 3

Great O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
service O -1 3
was O -1 3
dreadful! O -1 3

I O -1 3
also O -1 3
recommend O -1 3
the O -1 3
garlic B-ASP 2 3
knots. I-ASP 2 3

The O -1 3
dim B-ASP 2 3
sum I-ASP 2 3
however O -1 3
was O -1 3
very O -1 3
good. O -1 3

The O -1 0
waiters O -1 0
were O -1 0
not O -1 0
attentive O -1 0
except O -1 0
that O -1 0
the O -1 0
bill B-ASP 0 0
turned O -1 0
up O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
table O -1 0
before O -1 0
we O -1 0
were O -1 0
finished. O -1 0

Sandwiches, B-ASP 2 3
burgers O -1 3
and O -1 3
salads, O -1 3
like O -1 3
the O -1 3
lemon-dressed O -1 3
cobb, O -1 3
are O -1 3
classic O -1 3
successes. O -1 3

The O -1 3
entire O -1 3
place B-ASP 0 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
treatment O -1 3
we O -1 3
received O -1 3
felt O -1 3
as O -1 3
a O -1 3
conveyor O -1 3

Order O -1 3
the O -1 3
panang B-ASP 2 3
duck, I-ASP 2 3
it's O -1 3
fantastic. O -1 3

But O -1 3
dinner O -1 3
here O -1 3
is O -1 3
never O -1 3
disappointing(1), O -1 3
even O -1 3
if O -1 3

Unfortunately, O -1 0
we O -1 0
chose O -1 0
this O -1 0

(except O -1 0

After O -1 0

IT O -1 3
IS O -1 3
WHAT O -1 3
MODERN O -1 3
CUISINE B-ASP 2 3
IS O -1 3
ALL O -1 3
ABOUT. O -1 3

This O -1 3
place O -1 3

many O -1 3
different O -1 3
styles B-ASP 2 3
of I-ASP 2 3
pizza I-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
they O -1 3
are O -1 3
all O -1 3
amazing. O -1 3

It O -1 3
can O -1 3
be O -1 3
a O -1 3
little O -1 3
confusing O -1 3
as O -1 3
to O -1 3
where O -1 3
one O -1 3
goes O -1 3
to O -1 3
order, O -1 3
but O -1 3
once O -1 3
the O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
ordered, O -1 3
you O -1 3
are O -1 3
in O -1 3
for O -1 3
a O -1 3
treat. O -1 3

The O -1 4
svc B-ASP 0 4
can O -1 4
be O -1 4
a O -1 4
bit O -1 4
rude O -1 4
at O -1 4
times, O -1 4
esp O -1 4
if O -1 4
you O -1 4
have O -1 4
big O -1 4
group, O -1 4
but O -1 4
overall O -1 4
the O -1 4
restaurant O -1 4
is O -1 4
a O -1 4
must! O -1 4

I O -1 3
would O -1 3
definitely O -1 3
go O -1 3
back O -1 3
-- O -1 3
if O -1 3
only O -1 3
for O -1 3
some O -1 3
of O -1 3
those O -1 3
exotic O -1 3
martinis B-ASP 2 3
on O -1 3
the O -1 3

The O -1 3
corned B-ASP 2 3

tender O -1 3

melted O -1 3
in O -1 3
my O -1 3

This O -1 3
is O -1 3
a O -1 3

great O -1 3

to O -1 3

for O -1 3

Every O -1 3

The O -1 0

it O -1 0
feels O -1 0

Awsome O -1 3
Pizza B-ASP 2 3
especially O -1 3
the O -1 3
Margheritta O -1 3
slice. O -1 3

Given O -1 0
the O -1 0
incredible O -1 0
architecture O -1 0
surrounding O -1 0
it, O -1 0
this O -1 0
place B-ASP 0 0
has O -1 0
no O -1 0
character. O -1 0

We O -1 3
started O -1 3
with O -1 3
lox O -1 3
and O -1 3
mussels O -1 3
(the O -1 3
best O -1 3
ive O -1 3
ever O -1 3
had, O -1 3
ever) O -1 3
and O -1 3
had O -1 3
the O -1 3
cod B-ASP 1 3
and O -1 3
trout O -1 3
for O -1 3
dinner. O -1 3

Found O -1 3
service B-ASP 2 3
above O -1 3
average, O -1 3
but O -1 3
that O -1 3
could O -1 3
be O -1 3
because O -1 3
we O -1 3
were O -1 3
13 O -1 3
of O -1 3
us. O -1 3

The O -1 0
owner B-ASP 2 0
and O -1 0
staff O -1 0
are O -1 0
all O -1 0
Japanese O -1 0
as O -1 0
well O -1 0
and O -1 0
that O -1 0
adds O -1 0

the O -1 0
entire O -1 0

all O -1 1
look O -1 1
good O -1 1
on O -1 1

I've O -1 1
had O -1 1
better O -1 1
thai O -1 1

in O -1 1
less O -1 1
asthetically O -1 1
pleasing O -1 1
places. O -1 1

for O -1 3

we O -1 3
split(1) O -1 3
chocolate O -1 3
cake O -1 3
and O -1 3
vanilla I-ASP 3 3
gelato I-ASP 3 3
(with I-ASP 3 3
espresso), I-ASP 3 3
which O -1 3
were O -1 3
tasty, O -1 3
but O -1 3
I O -1 3
thought O -1 3
a O -1 3
bit O -1 3
overpriced(2). O -1 3

My O -1 1
suggestion O -1 1
is O -1 1
to O -1 1
eat B-ASP 2 1
family I-ASP 2 1
style I-ASP 2 1
because O -1 1
you'll O -1 1
want O -1 1
to O -1 1
try O -1 1
the O -1 1
other O -1 1
dishes. O -1 1

I O -1 3
took O -1 3
my O -1 3
girlfriend O -1 3
there O -1 3
for O -1 3
her O -1 3

we O -1 3
had O -1 3
a O -1 3
relaxing, O -1 3
really O -1 3
good O -1 3
meal. B-ASP 2 3

The O -1 3
takeout B-ASP 2 3

We O -1 1
couldn't O -1 1
carry O -1 1
our O -1 1

as O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
routinely O -1 1

The O -1 3
fried B-ASP 2 3

too. O -1 3

The O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0

dreadfully O -1 0
slow O -1 0
(the O -1 0

was O -1 0
only O -1 0

We O -1 3
all O -1 3

the O -1 3

unlike O -1 3
some O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3

I O -1 3
felt O -1 3
there O -1 3
was O -1 3
more O -1 3

enough(2) O -1 3

We O -1 0

I O -1 3

Even O -1 1

The O -1 0
most O -1 0

The O -1 3

The O -1 3

However, O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
summer O -1 3
of O -1 3
2003, O -1 3
it O -1 3
seems O -1 3
the O -1 3
management B-ASP 1 3
has O -1 3
changed O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
great O -1 3

The O -1 4

I O -1 4
the O -1 4

As O -1 3
a O -1 3
long-time O -1 3
patron O -1 3
of O -1 3
Mamoun's, O -1 3
I O -1 3
always O -1 3
figured O -1 3
that O -1 3
I O -1 3
had O -1 3
found O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3

Upon O -1 3

to O -1 3
be O -1 3
more O -1 3
than O -1 3

This O -1 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
perfect O -1 3

for O -1 3

hey, O -1 5

Meanwhile, O -1 3
the O -1 3

us O -1 3
actually O -1 3
liked O -1 3
the O -1 3
expresso B-ASP 2 3
- B-ASP 2 3
that's O -1 3
it. O -1 3

My O -1 1
biggest O -1 1
complaint O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
un-tasty O -1 1
food B-ASP 3 1
although O -1 1
presented O -1 1
well. O -1 1

I O -1 3
had O -1 3
the O -1 3
duck B-ASP 2 3
breast I-ASP 2 3
special I-ASP 2 3
on O -1 3
my O -1 3
last O -1 3
visit O -1 3
and O -1 3
it O -1 3
was O -1 3
incredible. O -1 3

The O -1 0
restaraurant O -1 0
is O -1 0
very O -1 0
small O -1 0
so O -1 0
reservations B-ASP 1 0
are O -1 0
a O -1 0
must. O -1 0

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
delicious O -1 3
(I O -1 3
had O -1 3
a O -1 3
halibut O -1 3
special, O -1 3
my O -1 3
husband O -1 3
had O -1 3
steak), O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
service O -1 3
was O -1 3
top-notch. O -1 3

The O -1 1
bruscetta O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
soggy, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
salads O -1 1
were O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1
included O -1 1
a O -1 1
nice O -1 1
mix O -1 1
of O -1 1
greens O -1 1
(not O -1 1
iceberg) O -1 1
all O -1 1
dishes B-ASP 2 1
are O -1 1
served O -1 1
piping O -1 1
hot O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
kitchen. O -1 1

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
authentic. O -1 3

For O -1 0
the O -1 0
next O -1 0
hour O -1 0
and O -1 0
a O -1 0
half O -1 0
we O -1 0
stood O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0
crowded O -1 0
lobby B-ASP 0 0
area I-ASP 0 0
of O -1 0
this O -1 0
touristy O -1 0
restaurant O -1 0
listening O -1 0
to O -1 0
all O -1 0
types O -1 0
of O -1 0
explanations O -1 0
of O -1 0
why O -1 0
we O -1 0
were O -1 0
not O -1 0
being O -1 0
seated. O -1 0

The O -1 3
service O -1 3
is O -1 3
friendly, O -1 3
if O -1 3
not O -1 3
the O -1 3
most O -1 3
prompt O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
world(1), O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
great(2), O -1 3
and O -1 3
the I-ASP 3 3
prices, O -1 3
while O -1 3
not O -1 3
cheap, O -1 3
won't O -1 3
put O -1 3
your O -1 3
wallet O -1 3
out O -1 3
of O -1 3
commission(3). O -1 3

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
weird O -1 1
thing O -1 1
was O -1 1
if O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a(1) O -1 1
bottle, O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
would O -1 1
have O -1 1
simply O -1 1
multiplied O -1 1
the O -1 1
glass O -1 1
price O -1 1
X4, O -1 1
which O -1 1
makes O -1 1
no O -1 1
sense O -1 1
whatsoever(2). O -1 1

It's O -1 5
like O -1 5
they O -1 5
took O -1 5
leftover O -1 5
chicken, O -1 5
poured O -1 5
oil O -1 5
and O -1 5
sprinkled O -1 5
pepper O -1 5
powder O -1 5
over O -1 5
it O -1 5
(the O -1 5
sauce B-ASP 0 5
was O -1 5
translucent O -1 5
and O -1 5
red). O -1 5

The O -1 4
food B-ASP 1 4
was O -1 4
mediocre(1) O -1 4
and O -1 4
the O -1 4
service O -1 4
was O -1 4
severely O -1 4
slow(2). O -1 4

I O -1 3
love O -1 3
the O -1 3
simplicity O -1 3
and O -1 3
respect O -1 3
which O -1 3
was O -1 3
given O -1 3
to O -1 3
the(1) O -1 3
food, O -1 3
as O -1 3
well O -1 3
the O -1 3
staff O -1 3
was O -1 3
freindly O -1 3
and O -1 3
knowledgable(2). O -1 3

On O -1 0
the O -1 0
other O -1 0
hand, O -1 0
if O -1 0
you O -1 0
are O -1 0
not O -1 0

easily, O -1 0
you O -1 0
will O -1 0

the O -1 3

was O -1 3
slightly O -1 3
disappointing. O -1 3

Having O -1 3

we O -1 3

this O -1 3

classical O -1 3

the O -1 3

given O -1 3
new O -1 3
life O -1 3
to O -1 3
an O -1 3
old O -1 3

that O -1 3
are O -1 3
genuinely O -1 3

Furthermore, O -1 0
the O -1 0

it O -1 3

is O -1 3

Service O -1 0
was O -1 0

was O -1 3
friendly O -1 3
and O -1 3
good. O -1 3

The O -1 3

The O -1 3

While O -1 3
this O -1 3

hardly O -1 3
be O -1 3
called O -1 3
a O -1 3

it O -1 3

The O -1 1

is O -1 1
ok O -1 1
but O -1 1
doesn't O -1 1
taste O -1 1
that O -1 1

the O -1 1

the O -1 3

Service B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
good(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
so O -1 3
was O -1 3
the(2) O -1 3
atmosphere. O -1 3

In O -1 1
fact, O -1 1
this O -1 1
was O -1 1
not O -1 1
a O -1 1
Nicoise B-ASP 0 1
salad I-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
was O -1 1
barely O -1 1
eatable. O -1 1

It O -1 0
was O -1 0
like O -1 0
the O -1 0
servers B-ASP 0 0
forgot O -1 0
that O -1 0
they O -1 0
actually O -1 0
worked O -1 0
there O -1 0
and O -1 0
instead O -1 0
wanted O -1 0
to O -1 0
hang O -1 0
out O -1 0
and O -1 0
be O -1 0
cool. O -1 0

The O -1 5
cuisine B-ASP 1 5
from O -1 5
what O -1 5
I've O -1 5
gathered O -1 5
is O -1 5
authentic O -1 5
Taiwanese, O -1 5
though O -1 5
its O -1 5
very O -1 5
different O -1 5
from O -1 5
what O -1 5
I've O -1 5
been O -1 5
accustomed O -1 5
to O -1 5
in O -1 5
Taipei. O -1 5

I'm O -1 3
looking O -1 3
forward O -1 3
to O -1 3
going O -1 3
back O -1 3
soon O -1 3
and O -1 3
eventually O -1 3
trying O -1 3
most O -1 3
everything O -1 3
on O -1 3
the O -1 3
menu! B-ASP 2 3

I O -1 3
don't O -1 3
like O -1 3
Indian B-ASP 2 3
food I-ASP 2 3
too O -1 3
much O -1 3
and O -1 3
this O -1 3
was O -1 3
delicious, O -1 3
however O -1 3
you O -1 3
want O -1 3
to O -1 3
factor O -1 3
that O -1 3

the O -1 3
equation. O -1 3

The O -1 3
ambience O -1 3

apparently O -1 0
never O -1 0
tried O -1 0
any O -1 0
of O -1 0
the(1) O -1 0
food, O -1 0
and O -1 0
there O -1 0
was O -1 0
no O -1 0
one O -1 0
to O -1 0
recommend(2) O -1 0
any O -1 0
wine. O -1 0

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
good, O -1 3
I O -1 3
can't O -1 3
lie. O -1 3

The O -1 1
food O -1 1
is O -1 1
usually O -1 1
good O -1 1
but O -1 1
it O -1 1
certainly O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
a O -1 1
relaxing O -1 1
place B-ASP 0 1
to O -1 1
go. O -1 1

It O -1 3
took O -1 3
about O -1 3
2 O -1 3
1/2 O -1 3
hours O -1 3
to O -1 3
be O -1 3
served B-ASP 0 3
our O -1 3
2 O -1 3
courses. O -1 3

Great O -1 3
for O -1 3
large O -1 3
groups O -1 3
and O -1 3
celebrations O -1 3
- O -1 3
our O -1 3
SUPER O -1 3
HAPPY O -1 3
waiter B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
the O -1 3
entertainment O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
evening. O -1 3

This O -1 4
made O -1 4
it O -1 4
obvious O -1 4
that O -1 4
the O -1 4
food B-ASP 0 4
wasn't O -1 4
cooked O -1 4
fresh; O -1 4
it O -1 4
was O -1 4
obviously O -1 4
made O -1 4
before O -1 4
hand O -1 4
and O -1 4
then O -1 4
reheated. O -1 4

I O -1 3
love(1) O -1 3
the O -1 3
drinks, O -1 3
esp O -1 3
lychee I-ASP 2 3
martini, O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
also O -1 3
VERY O -1 3
good(2). O -1 3

Whenever O -1 3
you O -1 3
need O -1 3
a O -1 3
Sushi O -1 3
fix, O -1 3
Mizu O -1 3
will O -1 3
be O -1 3
there O -1 3
with O -1 3
quality O -1 3
fish B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
great O -1 3
service. O -1 3

The O -1 3
menu B-ASP 2 3
has O -1 3
lots O -1 3
of O -1 3
options(1): O -1 3
I O -1 3
hope O -1 3
to O -1 3
go O -1 3
back(2) O -1 3
to O -1 3
try O -1 3
those O -1 3
potato O -1 3
pancakes. O -1 3

A O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
that O -1 3
doesn't O -1 3
try O -1 3
to O -1 3
do O -1 3
anything O -1 3
except O -1 3
serve O -1 3
great(1) O -1 3
food O -1 3
with O -1 3
great(2) O -1 3
service O -1 3
in O -1 3
a O -1 3
pleasant(3) O -1 3
atmosphere. O -1 3

Pair O -1 3
you O -1 3
food O -1 3
with O -1 3
the O -1 3
excellent O -1 3
beers B-ASP 2 3
on I-ASP 2 3
tap I-ASP 2 3
or O -1 3
their O -1 3
well O -1 3
priced O -1 3
wine O -1 3
list. O -1 3

The O -1 0
fillings B-ASP 1 0
may O -1 0
be O -1 0
unconventional(1) O -1 0
but O -1 0
the O -1 0
dosa O -1 0
batter O -1 0
is O -1 0
definitely O -1 0
authentic O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
combinations O -1 0
very O -1 0
tasty(2). O -1 0

And O -1 3
really O -1 3
large O -1 3
portions. B-ASP 2 3

Anyway, O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
good, O -1 3
the O -1 3
price B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
right O -1 3
and O -1 3
they O -1 3
have O -1 3
a O -1 3
decent O -1 3
wine O -1 3
list. O -1 3

Again, O -1 3
the O -1 3
waitress B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
awesome. O -1 3

Cute O -1 3
place, O -1 3
nice O -1 3
wait B-ASP 2 3
staff I-ASP 2 3
but O -1 3
would O -1 3
never O -1 3
go O -1 3
there O -1 3
again. O -1 3

Not O -1 3
only O -1 3
was O -1 3
the O -1 3
sushi B-ASP 2 3
fresh, O -1 3
they O -1 3
also O -1 3
served O -1 3
other(1) O -1 3
entrees O -1 3
allowed O -1 3
each O -1 3
guest O -1 3
something O -1 3
to O -1 3
choose O -1 3
from O -1 3
and O -1 3
we O -1 3
all O -1 3
left O -1 3
happy(2) O -1 3
(try O -1 3
the O -1 3
duck! O -1 3

Ive O -1 3
been O -1 3
here O -1 3
a O -1 3
bunch O -1 3
of O -1 3
times O -1 3
now O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
service B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
always O -1 3
outstanding. O -1 3

It O -1 3
took O -1 3
half O -1 3
an O -1 3
hour O -1 3
to O -1 3
get O -1 3
our O -1 3
check, O -1 3
which O -1 3
was O -1 3
perfect O -1 3
since O -1 3
we O -1 3
could O -1 3
sit, O -1 3
have O -1 3
drinks B-ASP 1 3
and O -1 3
talk! O -1 3

It's O -1 0
eaten O -1 0
with O -1 0
black O -1 0
vinegar O -1 0
and O -1 0
shredded B-ASP 1 0
ginger. I-ASP 1 0

While O -1 1
the O -1 1
ambiance O -1 1
and O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
were O -1 1
great, O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
and O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
could O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
better. O -1 1

We O -1 3
enjoyed O -1 3
ourselves O -1 3
thoroughly O -1 3
and O -1 3
will O -1 3
be O -1 3
going O -1 3
back O -1 3
for O -1 3
the O -1 3
desserts B-ASP 2 3
.... B-ASP 2 3

It's O -1 0
not O -1 0
mind-blowing, O -1 0
but O -1 0
to O -1 0
me, O -1 0
thai B-ASP 1 0
food I-ASP 1 0
never O -1 0
is O -1 0
and O -1 0
never O -1 0
will O -1 0
be. O -1 0

those O -1 2
rolls O -1 2
were O -1 2
big, O -1 2
but O -1 2
not O -1 2
good(1) O -1 2
and O -1 2
sashimi O -1 2
wasn't O -1 2
fresh(2). O -1 2

I O -1 0
stopped O -1 0
by O -1 0
for O -1 0
some O -1 0
brunch B-ASP 1 0
today O -1 0
and O -1 0
had O -1 0
the O -1 0
vegan O -1 0
cranberry O -1 0
pancakes O -1 0
and O -1 0
some O -1 0
rice O -1 0
milk. O -1 0

the O -1 0
real O -1 0
kicker O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
menu, O -1 0
however, O -1 0
is O -1 0
the O -1 0
beef B-ASP 2 0
cubes I-ASP 2 0
or O -1 0
the O -1 0
chicken O -1 0
with O -1 0
chili O -1 0
and O -1 0
lemon O -1 0
grass. O -1 0

The O -1 3
first O -1 3
2 O -1 3
courses O -1 3
were O -1 3
very O -1 3
good(1), O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
chocolate I-ASP 0 3
sampler O -1 3
was O -1 3
too O -1 3
rich O -1 3
for O -1 3
me(2) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
dessert O -1 3
wine O -1 3
far O -1 3
too O -1 3
sweet(3). O -1 3

I O -1 3
always O -1 3
get O -1 3
the O -1 3
Shabu-Shabu B-ASP 1 3
dinner I-ASP 1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
beef O -1 3
is O -1 3
always O -1 3
fresh. O -1 3

The O -1 3
service B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
attentive. O -1 3

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
amazing(1), O -1 3
rich(2) O -1 3
pastas O -1 3
and O -1 3
fresh O -1 3
doughy(3) O -1 3
pizza. O -1 3

now O -1 3
called O -1 3
nikki O -1 3
sushi, O -1 3
sushi B-ASP 1 3
is O -1 3
OK. O -1 3

The O -1 3
fries B-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
yummy. O -1 3

Succulent O -1 3
steaks O -1 3
cooked O -1 3
precisely O -1 3
to O -1 3
your O -1 3

sides O -1 3
that O -1 3
don't O -1 3
look O -1 3
like O -1 3
leafy O -1 3
road O -1 3
kill. O -1 3

The O -1 3
decor B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
vibrant O -1 3
and O -1 3
eye-pleasing O -1 3
with O -1 3
several O -1 3
semi-private O -1 3
boths O -1 3
on O -1 3
the O -1 3
right O -1 3
side O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
dining O -1 3

which O -1 3
are O -1 3
great O -1 3
for O -1 3
a O -1 3
date. O -1 3

I O -1 1
am O -1 1
reluctant O -1 1
to O -1 1
write O -1 1
because O -1 1
I O -1 1
would O -1 1
not O -1 1
want O -1 1
my O -1 1

make O -1 3
them O -1 3

good O -1 3
outdoor O -1 3

with O -1 3
a O -1 3
hip O -1 3
japanese O -1 3

my O -1 3

is O -1 3
an O -1 3
everything O -1 3
bagel B-ASP 2 3
with I-ASP 2 3

all O -1 3
the O -1 3

unbeliavably O -1 3

Went O -1 0
there O -1 0
for O -1 0
an O -1 0
office B-ASP 1 0
lunch. I-ASP 1 0

There O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
is O -1 3
very O -1 3
casual, O -1 3
but O -1 3
perfect(1) O -1 3
for O -1 3
lunch, O -1 3
and O -1 3
their O -1 3
delivery O -1 3
service O -1 3
is O -1 3
always O -1 3
very O -1 3
fast(2). O -1 3

Innovations O -1 3
are O -1 3
just O -1 3
as O -1 3
assured, O -1 3
from O -1 3

beautifully O -1 3
matched O -1 3
with O -1 3
a O -1 3
bright(2) O -1 3
green O -1 3

The O -1 3
Waitstaff O -1 3
were O -1 3
very O -1 3
nice O -1 3
and O -1 3
suggested O -1 3
swordfish O -1 3
for O -1 3
my O -1 3
husband O -1 3
he O -1 3
enjoyed O -1 3
his O -1 3
meal. B-ASP 2 3

Overall, O -1 3
the O -1 3
ingredients O -1 3
and O -1 3
technique O -1 3
are O -1 3
there O -1 3
and O -1 3
I O -1 3
am O -1 3
encouraged O -1 3
enough O -1 3
to O -1 3
return O -1 3
at O -1 3
lunch B-ASP 1 3
or O -1 3
dinner O -1 3
to O -1 3
see O -1 3
whether O -1 3
the O -1 3
boldness O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
flavour O -1 3
palette O -1 3
improves. O -1 3

Huge(1) O -1 3
portions, O -1 3
great O -1 3
and O -1 3
attentive(2) O -1 3
service, O -1 3
and O -1 3
pretty O -1 3
good(3) O -1 3
prices. O -1 3

they O -1 3
didn't O -1 3
disappoint, O -1 3
service O -1 3
from O -1 3
the O -1 3
second O -1 3
i O -1 3
arrived O -1 3
at O -1 3
the O -1 3
door O -1 3
was O -1 3
extremely O -1 3
pleasant O -1 3
and O -1 3
attentive O -1 3
with O -1 3
almost O -1 3
one O -1 3
server B-ASP 2 3
per O -1 3
table. O -1 3

In O -1 3
addition, O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
very O -1 3
good O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
prices B-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
reasonable. O -1 3

We O -1 3
parked O -1 3
on O -1 3
the O -1 3
block O -1 3
of O -1 3
Nina's O -1 3
the O -1 3
place O -1 3
looked O -1 3
nice, O -1 3
with O -1 3
people O -1 3
obviously O -1 3
enjoying O -1 3
their O -1 3
pizzas. B-ASP 2 3

I O -1 3
recommend O -1 3
the O -1 3
jelly O -1 3
fish, O -1 3
drunken B-ASP 2 3
chicken I-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
soupy O -1 3
dumplings, O -1 3
certainly O -1 3
the O -1 3
stir O -1 3
fry O -1 3
blue O -1 3
crab. O -1 3

How O -1 4
can O -1 4
hope O -1 4
to O -1 4
stay O -1 4
in O -1 4
business O -1 4
with O -1 4
service B-ASP 0 4
like O -1 4
this? O -1 4

As O -1 0
we O -1 0
were O -1 0
sitting O -1 0
eating O -1 0
the O -1 0
subpar O -1 0
food O -1 0
the O -1 0
manager B-ASP 0 0
proceeded O -1 0
to O -1 0
berate O -1 0
a O -1 0
couple O -1 0
of O -1 0
his O -1 0
employees O -1 0
for O -1 0
putting O -1 0
out O -1 0
the O -1 0
wrong O -1 0
containers O -1 0
for O -1 0
condiments O -1 0
and O -1 0
explained O -1 0
to O -1 0
them O -1 0
how O -1 0
expensive O -1 0
these O -1 0
containers O -1 0
were. O -1 0

The O -1 3
menu B-ASP 0 3
may O -1 3
be O -1 3
small, O -1 3
but O -1 3
everything O -1 3
on O -1 3
it O -1 3
is O -1 3
delicious. O -1 3

Anyway, O -1 2
the O -1 2
owner B-ASP 0 2
was O -1 2
fake. O -1 2

We O -1 0
were O -1 0
seated O -1 0
promptly O -1 0
as O -1 0
we O -1 0
had O -1 0
reservations, O -1 0
however O -1 0
after O -1 0
that O -1 0
the O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
slow. O -1 0

I O -1 3
particularly O -1 3
love O -1 3
their O -1 3
yellowfun B-ASP 2 3
tuna I-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
their O -1 3
mussel O -1 3
selection. O -1 3

Unlike O -1 3
other O -1 3
places O -1 3
in O -1 3
NYC O -1 3
where O -1 3
the O -1 3
sandwiches O -1 3
you O -1 3
want O -1 3
only O -1 3
come O -1 3
as O -1 3
a O -1 3
triple-decker, O -1 3
here O -1 3
you O -1 3
can O -1 3
get O -1 3
what O -1 3
you O -1 3
want O -1 3
in O -1 3
a O -1 3
reasonably-sized O -1 3
portion B-ASP 2 3
(and O -1 3
price). O -1 3

Incredible(1) O -1 3

a O -1 3

every O -1 3
other O -1 3
day O -1 3
to O -1 3
this O -1 3
authentic O -1 3
Thai O -1 3
restaurant. O -1 3

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
spicy O -1 3
and O -1 3
delicious. O -1 3

My O -1 3

was O -1 3
delicious(1) O -1 3
in O -1 3
an O -1 3

Chance O -1 3

cozy O -1 3
restaurant, O -1 3
with O -1 3
a O -1 3
romantic O -1 3
feel O -1 3
to O -1 3
it, O -1 3
the O -1 3
decor B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
great. O -1 3

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3

the O -1 3

The O -1 3

taste O -1 3
fresher, O -1 3
the O -1 3
crust O -1 3
is O -1 3
thinner O -1 3
and O -1 3
crispier, O -1 3
the O -1 3

less O -1 3
oily, O -1 3
and O -1 3
it's O -1 3
never O -1 3

the O -1 3

I O -1 0
guess O -1 0
that's O -1 0
the O -1 0
price O -1 0
you O -1 0
pay O -1 0
for O -1 0

we O -1 0
were O -1 0
highly O -1 0
disappointed O -1 0
by O -1 0
the O -1 0

not O -1 0

we O -1 3

As O -1 0
for O -1 0
the O -1 0

this O -1 0

another O -1 0
bad O -1 0

First O -1 3
walking O -1 3

the O -1 3

to O -1 3
have O -1 3

It's O -1 5
like O -1 5
they O -1 5
took O -1 5

the O -1 3

still O -1 3
choose O -1 3
to O -1 3

All O -1 3
in O -1 3
all O -1 3
the O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
above O -1 3

with O -1 3

While O -1 1
the O -1 1

the O -1 1

the O -1 3

the O -1 3

They O -1 3
do O -1 3

let O -1 3

a O -1 3

I O -1 3
went O -1 3
with O -1 3

we O -1 3

though O -1 3
there O -1 3

We O -1 0
ended O -1 0
up O -1 0

to O -1 0

believe O -1 3

I O -1 3
have O -1 3
been O -1 3

to O -1 3

We O -1 2

only O -1 2
get O -1 2

When O -1 3

there O -1 3
was O -1 3
a O -1 3
candle O -1 3

not O -1 3
because O -1 3
anyone O -1 3
asked O -1 3

because O -1 3
the O -1 3

opening O -1 3

but O -1 3
the O -1 3

which O -1 3
were O -1 3
tasty, O -1 3
but O -1 3
I O -1 3
thought O -1 3
a O -1 3
bit O -1 3
overpriced(2). O -1 3

The O -1 3
service O -1 3
was O -1 3
impeccable O -1 3

Not O -1 3
only O -1 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
authentic(1), O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
staff O -1 3
here O -1 3
are O -1 3
practically O -1 3
off-the-boat(2), O -1 3
they O -1 3
are O -1 3
young O -1 3
and O -1 3
hip O -1 3
and O -1 3
know O -1 3
what O -1 3
they O -1 3
are O -1 3
doing O -1 3
when O -1 3
it O -1 3
comes(3) O -1 3
to O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
wine. O -1 3

But O -1 3
they've O -1 3
done O -1 3
a O -1 3
really O -1 3
nice O -1 3
job O -1 3
of O -1 3
offering O -1 3
all O -1 3
the O -1 3
typical O -1 3
pizzeria O -1 3
faves O -1 3
plus O -1 3
some O -1 3
terrific O -1 3
specials B-ASP 2 3
like O -1 3
the O -1 3
Godmother O -1 3
pizza O -1 3
(a O -1 3
sort O -1 3
of O -1 3
traditional O -1 3

with O -1 3
an O -1 3
olive O -1 3
oil-brushed O -1 3

and O -1 3
less O -1 3
tomato O -1 3

than O -1 3
usual). O -1 3

The O -1 0
man O -1 0
that O -1 0
was O -1 0
hosting O -1 0
promised O -1 0
to O -1 0
save O -1 0
a O -1 0
table O -1 0
for O -1 0
our O -1 0

of O -1 0

the O -1 0
very O -1 0

Ingredients B-ASP 2 3

organic O -1 3
which O -1 3
is O -1 3
a O -1 3
real O -1 3
plus O -1 3
for O -1 3
me. O -1 3

I O -1 3
highly O -1 3
recommend O -1 3
visiting O -1 3
this O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
and O -1 3
having O -1 3
dinner B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3

mojitos B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
service O -1 3
are O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
part O -1 3
in O -1 3
there O -1 3

excellent(1) O -1 3
tapas O -1 3
at O -1 3
great O -1 3

With O -1 0
so O -1 0
many O -1 0
good O -1 0
restaurants O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
UWS, O -1 0
I O -1 0
don't O -1 0
need O -1 0
overpriced O -1 0
food, O -1 0
absurdly O -1 0
arrogant O -1 0
wait-staff O -1 0
who O -1 0
don't O -1 0
recognize O -1 0
they O -1 0
work O -1 0
at O -1 0
a O -1 0
glorified O -1 0
diner, B-ASP 0 0
clumsy O -1 0
service, O -1 0
and O -1 0
management O -1 0
that O -1 0
doesn't O -1 0
care. O -1 0

I O -1 1
have O -1 1
never O -1 1
had O -1 1
cheescake B-ASP 2 1
like O -1 1
this. O -1 1

THE O -1 0
BIG O -1 0
COMPLAINT: O -1 0
NO O -1 0
TOASTING B-ASP 0 0
AVAILABLE. O -1 0

We O -1 3
recently O -1 3
spent O -1 3
New O -1 3
Year's O -1 3
Eve O -1 3
at O -1 3
the O -1 3
restaurant, O -1 3
and O -1 3
had O -1 3
a O -1 3
great O -1 3
experience, O -1 3
from O -1 3
the O -1 3
wine B-ASP 2 3
to O -1 3
the O -1 3
dessert O -1 3
menu. O -1 3

The O -1 1
service O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
scatty O -1 1
at O -1 1
times O -1 1
but O -1 1
all O -1 1
is O -1 1
forgiven O -1 1
when O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 2 1
arrives. O -1 1

The O -1 3
food, O -1 3
drinks O -1 3
and O -1 3
service B-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
clearly O -1 3
among O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
city. O -1 3

The O -1 3
waiters B-ASP 2 3
were O -1 3
very O -1 3
professional, O -1 3
courteous O -1 3
and O -1 3
attentive. O -1 3

good O -1 3
music, B-ASP 2 3
great O -1 3
food, O -1 3
speedy O -1 3
service O -1 3
affordable O -1 3
prices. O -1 3

Yes, O -1 1
they're O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
more O -1 1
expensive O -1 1
then O -1 1
typical, O -1 1
but O -1 1
then O -1 1
again, O -1 1
so O -1 1
is O -1 1
their O -1 1
food. B-ASP 2 1

MY O -1 4
date O -1 4
and O -1 4
I O -1 4
both O -1 4
ordered O -1 4
the O -1 4
Branzini O -1 4
and O -1 4
both O -1 4
felt O -1 4
the O -1 4
fish B-ASP 0 4
was O -1 4
very O -1 4
average. O -1 4

The O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
great(1), O -1 3
I O -1 3
love O -1 3
their(2) O -1 3
dumplings, O -1 3
cold O -1 3
sesame O -1 3
noodles, O -1 3
chicken O -1 3
and O -1 3
shrimp O -1 3
dishs. O -1 3

My O -1 0
friends O -1 0
and O -1 0
I O -1 0
stop O -1 0
here O -1 0
for O -1 0
pizza B-ASP 1 0
before O -1 0
hitting O -1 0
the O -1 0
Kips O -1 0
Bay O -1 0
movie O -1 0
theater. O -1 0

The O -1 3
appetizing O -1 3
is O -1 3
excellent O -1 3
- O -1 3
just O -1 3
as O -1 3
good O -1 3
as O -1 3
Zabars O -1 3
Barney O -1 3
Greengrass O -1 3
at O -1 3
a O -1 3
reasonable O -1 3
price B-ASP 2 3
(if O -1 3
bought O -1 3
by O -1 3
the O -1 3
pound). O -1 3

This O -1 0
wasn't O -1 0
the O -1 0
expected(1) O -1 0
menu O -1 0
comprised O -1 0
only O -1 0
of B-ASP 1 0
pad I-ASP 1 0
thai O -1 0
and O -1 0
tom O -1 0
yum O -1 0
soup, O -1 0
but O -1 0
I O -1 0
thought O -1 0
that O -1 0
was O -1 0
what O -1 0
made O -1 0
the O -1 0
place O -1 0
so O -1 0
special(2). O -1 0

The O -1 0
miso O -1 0
soup O -1 0
lacked O -1 0
flavor O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
fish B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
unfortunately O -1 0
not O -1 0
as O -1 0
well O -1 0
prepared O -1 0
as O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0
past. O -1 0

For O -1 5
the O -1 5
price O -1 5
you O -1 5
pay O -1 5
for O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 0 5
here, O -1 5
you'd O -1 5
expect O -1 5
it O -1 5
to O -1 5
be O -1 5
at O -1 5
least O -1 5
on O -1 5
par O -1 5
with O -1 5
other O -1 5
Japanese O -1 5
restaurants. O -1 5

Food O -1 3
is O -1 3
excellent(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
they O -1 3
also O -1 3
have O -1 3
empenadas O -1 3
and O -1 3
plaintains O -1 3
which O -1 3
are O -1 3
good O -1 3
for(2) O -1 3
an O -1 3
afternoon O -1 3
snack. O -1 3

the O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
delicious O -1 3
and O -1 3
highly O -1 3
recommended. O -1 3

The O -1 3
desserts B-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
more O -1 3
appealing O -1 3
then O -1 3
stuffy O -1 3
overpriced O -1 3
French O -1 3
restaurants. O -1 3

The O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
scatty O -1 1
at O -1 1
times O -1 1
but O -1 1
all O -1 1
is O -1 1
forgiven O -1 1
when O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
arrives. O -1 1

We O -1 1
got O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
tipsy O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
sake B-ASP 1 1
but O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
that O -1 1
what O -1 1
Saturday O -1 1
nights O -1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1
girlfriends O -1 1
are O -1 1
all O -1 1
about? O -1 1

both O -1 3
are O -1 3
very O -1 3
reasonably(1) O -1 3
priced O -1 3
(around O -1 3
$8 O -1 3
for O -1 3
dinner O -1 3
and O -1 3
$5 O -1 3
for O -1 3
lunch), O -1 3
and O -1 3
are O -1 3
delicious O -1 3
and O -1 3
filling(2). O -1 3

My O -1 3
host O -1 3
asked O -1 3
for O -1 3
appetizers B-ASP 1 3
for O -1 3
the O -1 3
group O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
waiter O -1 3
gave O -1 3
us O -1 3
not O -1 3
only O -1 3
what O -1 3
we O -1 3
ordered, O -1 3
but O -1 3
some O -1 3
other O -1 3
items O -1 3
that O -1 3
were O -1 3
not O -1 3
ordered. O -1 3

The O -1 3
ambience B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
very O -1 3
romantic(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
definitely O -1 3
a O -1 3
good(2) O -1 3
place O -1 3
to O -1 3
bring O -1 3
a O -1 3
date. O -1 3

The O -1 5
one O -1 5
vegetarian O -1 5
entree O -1 5
(Abby's O -1 5
treasure) O -1 5
was O -1 5
actually O -1 5
quite O -1 5
a O -1 5
surprise O -1 5
- O -1 5
it O -1 5
was O -1 5
delicious O -1 5
and O -1 5
had O -1 5
wintermelon O -1 5
covering O -1 5
an O -1 5
assortment B-ASP 2 5
of I-ASP 2 5
fresh I-ASP 2 5
mushrooms I-ASP 2 5
and I-ASP 2 5
vegetables. I-ASP 2 5

The O -1 0
Sashimi O -1 0
portion O -1 0
are O -1 0
big O -1 0
enough O -1 0
to O -1 0
appease O -1 0
most O -1 0
people(1), O -1 0
but O -1 0
I O -1 0
didn't O -1 0
like O -1 0
the O -1 0
fact(2) O -1 0
they O -1 0
used I-ASP 0 0
artifical I-ASP 0 0
lobster O -1 0
meat. O -1 0

The O -1 5
place's O -1 5
decor O -1 5
and O -1 5
hidden(1) O -1 5
bathrooms O -1 5
made O -1 5
for O -1 5
a O -1 5
good O -1 5
laugh(2). O -1 5

The O -1 3
caeser B-ASP 2 3
salad I-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
great. O -1 3

We O -1 3
were O -1 3
told O -1 3
that O -1 3
the O -1 3
wait B-ASP 1 3
was O -1 3
about O -1 3
twenty O -1 3
minutes O -1 3
and O -1 3
there O -1 3
would O -1 3
be O -1 3
no O -1 3
problem O -1 3
for O -1 3
our O -1 3
8:00 O -1 3
pm O -1 3
curtain O -1 3
call. O -1 3

Yeah, O -1 0
sometimes O -1 0
the O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
can O -1 0
be O -1 0
slow. O -1 0

On O -1 0
the O -1 0
other O -1 0
hand, O -1 0
if O -1 0
you O -1 0
are O -1 0
not O -1 0
fooled O -1 0
easily, O -1 0
you O -1 0
will O -1 0
find O -1 0
hundreds O -1 0
of O -1 0
restaurants O -1 0
that O -1 0
will O -1 0
give O -1 0
you O -1 0

and O -1 0
ambiance O -1 0
that O -1 0
is O -1 0
on O -1 0

with O -1 0
Alain O -1 0
Ducasse, O -1 0
and O -1 0
food O -1 0
that O -1 0

outshine O -1 0
in O -1 0
presentaion, B-ASP 0 0
taste, O -1 0
choice, O -1 0

and O -1 0

You O -1 3
can O -1 3
get O -1 3
an O -1 3
excellent O -1 3
meal B-ASP 2 3
at O -1 3
most O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
many O -1 3
Indian O -1 3

on O -1 3
nearby O -1 3
Lexington O -1 3

the O -1 3
cost O -1 3
of O -1 3
one O -1 3
the O -1 3
dainty O -1 3

here. O -1 3

The O -1 5
food O -1 5
and O -1 5
staff B-ASP 2 5
always O -1 5
surprise O -1 5
me O -1 5
with O -1 5
the O -1 5
new O -1 5
heights O -1 5
they O -1 5
are O -1 5
taken O -1 5
to. O -1 5

I O -1 3
ordered O -1 3
tamarind B-ASP 2 3
duck I-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
my O -1 3
wife O -1 3
ordered O -1 3
noodles O -1 3
with O -1 3
ground O -1 3
beef, O -1 3
and O -1 3
we O -1 3
were O -1 3
both O -1 3
delighted O -1 3
by O -1 3
the O -1 3
way O -1 3
the O -1 3
dishes O -1 3
evoked O -1 3
Thai O -1 3
flavors O -1 3
in O -1 3
unexpected O -1 3
ways. O -1 3

This O -1 2
place O -1 2
must O -1 2
have O -1 2
cost O -1 2
the O -1 2
owners B-ASP 1 2
afortune O -1 2
to O -1 2
build. O -1 2

If O -1 3
it O -1 3
isn't O -1 3
for O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
(A), O -1 3
it O -1 3
must O -1 3
be O -1 3
the O -1 3
service O -1 3
or O -1 3
the O -1 3
ambience. O -1 3

And O -1 3
the O -1 3
food, B-ASP 2 3
well O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
will O -1 3
keep O -1 3
you O -1 3
coming O -1 3
back. O -1 3

As O -1 0
far O -1 0
as O -1 0
the O -1 0
service B-ASP 3 0
goes, O -1 0
the O -1 0
waitresses O -1 0
were O -1 0
not O -1 0
particularly O -1 0
friendly, O -1 0
but O -1 0
they O -1 0
got O -1 0
the O -1 0
job O -1 0
done. O -1 0

Prices O -1 3
are O -1 3
higher O -1 3
to O -1 3
dine O -1 3
in O -1 3
and O -1 3
their O -1 3
chicken B-ASP 2 3
tikka I-ASP 2 3
marsala I-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
quite O -1 3
good. O -1 3

Although O -1 3
we O -1 3
were O -1 3
looking O -1 3
for O -1 3
regular O -1 3
lettuce O -1 3
and O -1 3
some O -1 3
walnuts O -1 3
the O -1 3
salads B-ASP 2 3
we O -1 3
got O -1 3
were O -1 3
great. O -1 3

So O -1 0
we O -1 0
sat O -1 0
at O -1 0
the O -1 0
bar, O -1 0
the O -1 0
bartender B-ASP 0 0
didn't O -1 0
seem O -1 0
like O -1 0
he O -1 0
wanted O -1 0
to O -1 0
be O -1 0
there. O -1 0

Oh O -1 1
yes, O -1 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
lie O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
phone, O -1 1
claiming O -1 1
they O -1 1
have O -1 1
seating O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
garden, O -1 1
then O -1 1
of O -1 1
course O -1 1
the O -1 1
seats B-ASP 1 1
are O -1 1
not O -1 1
available. O -1 1

My O -1 3
wife O -1 3
and O -1 3
I O -1 3
will O -1 3
usually O -1 3
only O -1 3
order O -1 3
one(1) O -1 3
primi O -1 3
and O -1 3
one O -1 3
secondi O -1 3
and O -1 3
split O -1 3
them, O -1 3
as O -1 3
they O -1 3
tend O -1 3
to O -1 3
offer O -1 3
large(2) O -1 3
portions. O -1 3

My O -1 3
friends O -1 3
and O -1 3
I O -1 3
experienced O -1 3
amazing O -1 3
cheese B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
a O -1 3
delicious, O -1 3
new O -1 3
summer O -1 3
menu O -1 3
at O -1 3
Artisanal O -1 3
last O -1 3
night. O -1 3

You O -1 0
will O -1 0
pay O -1 0
a O -1 0
lot O -1 0
for(1) O -1 0
the O -1 0
decore, O -1 0
but O -1 0
the O -1 0
food O -1 0
is O -1 0
no O -1 0
better O -1 0
or O -1 0
worse O -1 0
than O -1 0
a O -1 0
lot O -1 0
of O -1 0
other O -1 0
Chinese O -1 0
and O -1 0
Asian O -1 0
fusion O -1 0
places O -1 0

NY(2). O -1 0

Service B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
usually O -1 3
pretty O -1 3
good. O -1 3

Considering O -1 0
their O -1 0
price O -1 0
of O -1 0
$6.25 O -1 0
for O -1 0
lunch O -1 0
special, O -1 0
the O -1 0
dish B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
ridiculously O -1 0
small. O -1 0

The O -1 0
food B-ASP 1 0
was O -1 0
so-so. O -1 0

Fabulous O -1 3
service, O -1 3
fantastic O -1 3
food, O -1 3
and O -1 3
a O -1 3
chilled O -1 3
out O -1 3

The O -1 1

is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
soggy, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1

The O -1 0

I O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
from O -1 0
here O -1 0
my O -1 0

spicy O -1 0
that O -1 0
I O -1 0
could O -1 0
barely O -1 0
eat O -1 0
it(1), O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0

However, O -1 3
there O -1 3
is O -1 3
just O -1 3
something O -1 3
so O -1 3
great(1) O -1 3
about O -1 3

The O -1 3

was O -1 4
highly O -1 4
disappointed O -1 4
by O -1 4
their O -1 4

Luckily O -1 3

But O -1 1
they O -1 1
don't O -1 1
have O -1 1
a O -1 1
toaster, B-ASP 0 1
which O -1 1
is O -1 1
strange. O -1 1

Decor O -1 3
is O -1 3
nice O -1 3

simple O -1 3

the O -1 3

the O -1 3

very O -1 3
well. O -1 3

The O -1 3
ambience B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
also O -1 3
more O -1 3

The O -1 1

isn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
greatest O -1 1
, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I O -1 1
suppose O -1 1
that's O -1 1
how O -1 1
they O -1 1

was O -1 3
just O -1 3
what O -1 3
we O -1 3
were O -1 3
looking O -1 3
for. O -1 3

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
amazing!!!! O -1 3

This O -1 3
place O -1 3
doesn't O -1 3
compare O -1 3
with O -1 3
Mamoun's O -1 3
in O -1 3
terms(1) O -1 3
of B-ASP 0 3
price, O -1 3
freshness, O -1 3
value, O -1 3
and O -1 3
consisent(2) O -1 3
quality, O -1 3
but O -1 3
that's O -1 3
just O -1 3
my O -1 3
opinion. O -1 3

It's O -1 3
a O -1 3
nice O -1 3
place B-ASP 2 3
to O -1 3
relax O -1 3
and O -1 3
have O -1 3
conversation. O -1 3

The O -1 3
pizza B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
really O -1 3
good. O -1 3

Furthermore, O -1 0
the O -1 0
rice O -1 0
had O -1 0
no(1) O -1 0

so O -1 0
the O -1 0
sushi O -1 0
was O -1 0
bland O -1 0
and O -1 0
disgusting(2). O -1 0

The O -1 3
whole O -1 3
set O -1 3
up O -1 3
is O -1 3
truly O -1 3
unprofessional O -1 3
and O -1 3
I O -1 3
wish O -1 3
Cafe O -1 3
Noir O -1 3
would O -1 3
get O -1 3
some O -1 3
good O -1 3
staff, B-ASP 0 3
because O -1 3
despite O -1 3
the O -1 3
current O -1 3
one O -1 3
this O -1 3
is O -1 3
a O -1 3
great O -1 3
place. O -1 3

The O -1 3

heavenly(1)- O -1 0
not O -1 0
too O -1 0

We O -1 3
figured O -1 3
we O -1 3
never O -1 3
had O -1 3

so O -1 3
we O -1 3

the O -1 3

both O -1 3

excellente(2). O -1 3

for O -1 3
about O -1 3
eleven O -1 3
bucks O -1 3
you O -1 3
get O -1 3
a O -1 3

the O -1 3

if O -1 3
I O -1 3
must O -1 3
recommend O -1 3
a O -1 3

decent O -1 3
at O -1 3
best, O -1 3

the O -1 3

well, O -1 3
it's O -1 3
a O -1 3

consider O -1 3
it O -1 3
to O -1 3
be O -1 3
a O -1 3
sweet O -1 3
thing, O -1 3
I O -1 3
thought O -1 3
it O -1 3
was O -1 3
just O -1 3
annoying. O -1 3

This O -1 3

definitely O -1 3
an O -1 3
excellent O -1 3
date O -1 3

because O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3

on O -1 3
the O -1 3

the O -1 3

french O -1 3

over I-ASP 1 3
a I-ASP 1 3
glass O -1 3

They O -1 3
have O -1 3
homemade B-ASP 2 3
pastas I-ASP 2 3
of O -1 3
all O -1 3
kinds O -1 3
-- O -1 3
I O -1 3

the O -1 3

The O -1 3
bar B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
very O -1 3
well O -1 3
stocked O -1 3
with O -1 3
interesting O -1 3
beers O -1 3
and O -1 3
well O -1 3
priced O -1 3
wines. O -1 3

The O -1 3
waiters O -1 3
and O -1 3
owners B-ASP 0 3
were O -1 3
nonchalant O -1 3
about O -1 3
this O -1 3
and O -1 3
promised O -1 3
to O -1 3
call O -1 3
the O -1 3
exterminator O -1 3
but O -1 3
weren't O -1 3
as O -1 3
dismayed O -1 3
or O -1 3
apologetic O -1 3
as O -1 3
I O -1 3
would O -1 3
have O -1 3
expected. O -1 3

The O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
is O -1 3
rather O -1 3
small O -1 3
but O -1 3
we O -1 3
were O -1 3
lucky O -1 3
to O -1 3
get O -1 3
a O -1 3
table B-ASP 2 3
quickly. O -1 3

If O -1 0

favorite O -1 0
Chinese O -1 0
food O -1 0
is O -1 0
General B-ASP 0 0
Tao I-ASP 0 0

then O -1 0
this O -1 0
is O -1 0
NOT O -1 0
your O -1 0
place. O -1 0

You O -1 5
must O -1 5
try O -1 5
the O -1 5
garlic B-ASP 2 5
soup! I-ASP 2 5

The O -1 3
staff B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
knowledgeable O -1 3
and O -1 3
full O -1 3
of O -1 3
personality. O -1 3

and O -1 2
you O -1 2
can't O -1 2
beat O -1 2
the O -1 2
prices. B-ASP 2 2

It O -1 0
only O -1 0
took O -1 0
about O -1 0
five O -1 0
or O -1 0
so O -1 0
minutes O -1 0
to O -1 0
get O -1 0
an O -1 0
empty O -1 0
table, B-ASP 2 0
but O -1 0
standing O -1 0
up O -1 0
wasn't O -1 0
too O -1 0
bad. O -1 0

My O -1 3
goodness, O -1 3
everything O -1 3
from O -1 3
the O -1 3
fish B-ASP 2 3
to O -1 3
the O -1 3
rice O -1 3
to O -1 3
the O -1 3
seaweed O -1 3
was O -1 3
absolutely O -1 3
amazing. O -1 3

Sure, O -1 3
the O -1 3
setting B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
nice. O -1 3

I O -1 3
liked O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
at O -1 3
this O -1 3
quasi-thai B-ASP 2 3
restaurant. O -1 3

We O -1 3
have O -1 3
been O -1 3
to O -1 3
this O -1 3
place O -1 3
many O -1 3
times, O -1 3
and O -1 3
always O -1 3
have O -1 3
great O -1 3
food, O -1 3
wine, B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
service. O -1 3

Only O -1 1
complaint O -1 1
would O -1 1
be O -1 1
that O -1 1
at O -1 1
an O -1 1
average O -1 1
cost O -1 1
of O -1 1
$12-$15 O -1 1
per O -1 1
meal, O -1 1
I'd O -1 1
like O -1 1
not O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
worry O -1 1
about O -1 1
finding O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat! B-ASP 0 1

The O -1 3

is B-ASP 2 3

The O -1 0

what O -1 0
the O -1 0

The O -1 3

is O -1 3
good(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3

good O -1 3

Stuffing O -1 0
yourself O -1 0
with O -1 0
Japanese B-ASP 1 0
food I-ASP 1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
rare O -1 0
thing. O -1 0

The O -1 0
red O -1 0

tasteless(1), O -1 0
the O -1 0

the O -1 1

didn't O -1 1

An O -1 3
excellent O -1 3
service B-ASP 2 3

I O -1 3
was O -1 3
especially O -1 3
impressed O -1 3
during O -1 3
the O -1 3
bday O -1 3
party O -1 3
when O -1 3
the O -1 3

however, O -1 0
it's O -1 0
the O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
that O -1 0
leaves O -1 0
a O -1 0
bad O -1 0

In O -1 1
terms O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
itself O -1 1
-- O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
special, O -1 1
we O -1 1
limited O -1 1
ourselves O -1 1
to O -1 1
several O -1 1
appetizers. O -1 1

The O -1 3
manager B-ASP 1 3
then O -1 3
told O -1 3
us O -1 3
we O -1 3
could O -1 3
order O -1 3
from O -1 3
whatever(1) O -1 3
menu O -1 3
we O -1 3
wanted O -1 3
but O -1 3
by O -1 3
that O -1 3
time O -1 3
we O -1 3
were O -1 3
so O -1 3
annoyed(2) O -1 3
with O -1 3
the O -1 3
waiter O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
resturant O -1 3
that O -1 3
we O -1 3
let O -1 3
and O -1 3
went O -1 3
some O -1 3
place O -1 3
else(3). O -1 3

It O -1 0
appears O -1 0
to O -1 0
be O -1 0
the O -1 0
owner's O -1 0
first O -1 0
venture O -1 0
and O -1 0
it O -1 0
shows. O -1 0

A O -1 0
gentleman, B-ASP 0 0
maybe O -1 0
the O -1 0
manager, O -1 0
came O -1 0
to O -1 0
our O -1 0

without O -1 0
so O -1 0
much O -1 0
as O -1 0
a O -1 0

The O -1 3

the O -1 3

the O -1 3

I O -1 5
couldn't O -1 5
believe O -1 5
the O -1 5
food. B-ASP 2 5

Consequently, O -1 0
their O -1 0
burgers B-ASP 0 0
fell O -1 0
apart O -1 0

made O -1 0
such O -1 0
a O -1 0

that O -1 0
they O -1 0
did'nt O -1 0

The O -1 3

the O -1 3

Our O -1 0

had O -1 0
apparently O -1 0
never O -1 0
tried O -1 0
any O -1 0

The O -1 0

unheralded, O -1 0
the O -1 0
service O -1 0
impecible, O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
food B-ASP 2 0
magnificant. O -1 0

I O -1 0
plan O -1 0
to O -1 0
come O -1 0
here O -1 0
again O -1 0
and O -1 0
look O -1 0
forward O -1 0
to O -1 0
trying O -1 0
their O -1 0

The O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
uniformly O -1 3
exceptional, O -1 3
with O -1 3
a O -1 3
very O -1 3
capable O -1 3
kitchen B-ASP 2 3
which O -1 3
will O -1 3
proudly O -1 3
whip O -1 3
up O -1 3
whatever O -1 3
you O -1 3
feel O -1 3
like O -1 3
eating, O -1 3
whether O -1 3
it's O -1 3
on O -1 3
the O -1 3
menu O -1 3
or O -1 3
not. O -1 3

The O -1 3
sangria B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
pretty O -1 3
tasty O -1 3
and O -1 3
good O -1 3
on O -1 3
a O -1 3
hot O -1 3
muggy O -1 3
day. O -1 3

Not O -1 3
only O -1 3
was O -1 3
the O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
outstanding, O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
little O -1 3
'perks' O -1 3
were O -1 3
great. O -1 3

Food O -1 3
was O -1 3
very O -1 3
good O -1 3
as O -1 3
well, O -1 3
considering O -1 3
that O -1 3
we O -1 3
tried O -1 3
the O -1 3
budget O -1 3
selection O -1 3
(though O -1 3
I O -1 3
wish O -1 3
the O -1 3
pork B-ASP 0 3
belly I-ASP 0 3
that O -1 3
I O -1 3
ordered O -1 3
was O -1 3
roasted O -1 3
a O -1 3
bit O -1 3
longer, O -1 3
so O -1 3
that O -1 3
fat O -1 3
was O -1 3
more O -1 3

a O -1 3
melt-in-your-mouth O -1 3

when O -1 5

are O -1 5
right O -1 5

I O -1 3
found O -1 3
it O -1 3

the O -1 3
perfect O -1 3

There O -1 1

also O -1 1
very O -1 1

Ambiance B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
music O -1 3
funky, O -1 3
which O -1 3
I O -1 3
enjoy. O -1 3

The O -1 3
wine B-ASP 2 3
list I-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
excellent. O -1 3

Because O -1 3
we O -1 3
didn't O -1 3
have O -1 3
a O -1 3
reservation, B-ASP 0 3
we O -1 3
could O -1 3
only O -1 3
sit O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
back O -1 3
garden, O -1 3
but O -1 3
it O -1 3
was O -1 3
great, O -1 3
secluded O -1 3
and O -1 3
perfect O -1 3
in O -1 3
nice O -1 3
weather. O -1 3

The O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
good(1), O -1 3
the O -1 3
service O -1 3
prompt(2), O -1 3
and O -1 3
the I-ASP 2 3
price O -1 3
very O -1 3
reasonable(3). O -1 3

My O -1 3
wife O -1 3
and O -1 3
I O -1 3
will O -1 3
usually O -1 3
only O -1 3
order O -1 3
one(1) O -1 3

one O -1 3

and O -1 3
split O -1 3

as O -1 3
they O -1 3
tend O -1 3

offer O -1 3
large(2) O -1 3

Right O -1 3
off O -1 3
the O -1 3

in O -1 3
Brooklyn O -1 3
this O -1 3
is O -1 3
a O -1 3
nice O -1 3
cozy O -1 3

with O -1 3
good O -1 3
pizza. O -1 3

The O -1 3
atmosphere B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
great!!! O -1 3

Maybe O -1 0
I O -1 0
say O -1 0
so O -1 0
because O -1 0
it O -1 0
looked O -1 0
promising O -1 0
for O -1 0
people O -1 0
who O -1 0
like O -1 0
artery-clogging O -1 0
jewish B-ASP 3 0

turns O -1 0
out O -1 0
to O -1 0
be O -1 0
poorly O -1 0
run O -1 0
and O -1 0
awful. O -1 0

Winnie O -1 3

her O -1 3

are O -1 3
the O -1 3

Furthermore, O -1 0
the O -1 0
rice O -1 0
had O -1 0
no(1) O -1 0
seasoning, O -1 0
so O -1 0
the O -1 0

was O -1 0
bland O -1 0
and O -1 0
disgusting(2). O -1 0

But O -1 3
they've O -1 3
done O -1 3

there O -1 3
(the O -1 3
host, O -1 3
the O -1 3
bartender, O -1 3
the O -1 3

is O -1 3
so O -1 3
helpful. O -1 3

Food B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
very O -1 3
good O -1 3
as O -1 3
well, O -1 3
considering O -1 3
that O -1 3
we O -1 3
tried O -1 3
the O -1 3
budget O -1 3

(though O -1 3
I O -1 3
wish O -1 3
the O -1 3
pork O -1 3

that O -1 3
I O -1 3
ordered O -1 3
was O -1 3
roasted O -1 3
a O -1 3

longer, O -1 3
so O -1 3
that O -1 3

more O -1 3

a O -1 3
melt-in-your-mouth O -1 3

Admittedly, O -1 3
this O -1 3

not O -1 3

The O -1 3

an O -1 3

The O -1 3

although O -1 3
it O -1 3

it O -1 3
was O -1 3
not O -1 3

that O -1 3

at O -1 3
those O -1 3

a O -1 3

It's O -1 5

nothing O -1 5

and O -1 5
that's O -1 5
all O -1 5
we O -1 5

And O -1 3
all O -1 3
the O -1 3

in O -1 3

Food B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3

even O -1 3
on O -1 3
a O -1 3

rainy O -1 3
day O -1 3
like O -1 3
that O -1 3
of O -1 3
when O -1 3
I O -1 3
went. O -1 3

The O -1 3
quail B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
fantastic O -1 3
and O -1 3
unique O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
pastas O -1 3
were O -1 3
full O -1 3
of O -1 3
flavor. O -1 3

Not O -1 3
only O -1 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
authentic(1), O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
staff O -1 3
here O -1 3
are O -1 3
practically O -1 3
off-the-boat(2), O -1 3
they O -1 3
are O -1 3
young O -1 3
and O -1 3
hip O -1 3
and O -1 3
know O -1 3
what O -1 3
they O -1 3
are O -1 3
doing O -1 3
when O -1 3
it O -1 3
comes(3) O -1 3
to O -1 3
food O -1 3
and O -1 3

The O -1 3
waiters O -1 3
are O -1 3
sweet(1), O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
tasty(2) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
bill O -1 3
is O -1 3
never O -1 3
too O -1 3
large(3). O -1 3

Any O -1 1
if O -1 1
you O -1 1
have O -1 1
a O -1 1
reservation O -1 1
you'll O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
max O -1 1
5 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
- O -1 1
so O -1 1
have O -1 1
a O -1 1
drink B-ASP 1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
bar. O -1 1

So, O -1 3
a O -1 3
little O -1 3
inconsistency O -1 3
there O -1 3
but O -1 3
either O -1 3
way, O -1 3
both O -1 3
pizzas B-ASP 2 3
were O -1 3
really O -1 3
good. O -1 3

Entrees B-ASP 1 3

like O -1 3
lasagna, O -1 3
fettuccine O -1 3

The O -1 3
only O -1 3

was O -1 3
the O -1 3

ambiance O -1 3
is O -1 3
minimal(1) O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
not O -1 3
phenomenal(2), O -1 3
but O -1 3
some I-ASP 2 3

are O -1 3
quite O -1 3

The O -1 3
unattractive(1) O -1 3

made O -1 3
me O -1 3
want O -1 3
to O -1 3
gag, O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
overpriced(2), O -1 3

with O -1 3
the O -1 3

The O -1 0
miso B-ASP 0 0

and O -1 0
the O -1 0

not O -1 0
as O -1 0
well O -1 0
prepared O -1 0

the O -1 0

Had O -1 0

could O -1 0
understand O -1 0
where O -1 0
they O -1 0
were O -1 0
coming O -1 0
from, O -1 0
but O -1 0
we O -1 0
had O -1 0
been O -1 0
there O -1 0
less O -1 0
than O -1 0
an O -1 0
hour O -1 0
and O -1 0
they O -1 0
hadn't O -1 0
even O -1 0
brought O -1 0

The O -1 3

were O -1 3
attentive, O -1 3
polite O -1 3
and O -1 3
helpful O -1 3
- O -1 3
an O -1 3
impressive O -1 3
feat O -1 3
in O -1 3
such O -1 3
close O -1 3

Yes O -1 0
you O -1 0
have O -1 0
to(1) O -1 0
wait O -1 0

the O -1 0

the O -1 0

all O -1 0
taken. O -1 0

The O -1 1
portions O -1 1
are O -1 1
HUGE, O -1 1
so O -1 1
it O -1 1
might O -1 1
be O -1 1
good O -1 1
to O -1 1
order O -1 1
three O -1 1
things O -1 1
to O -1 1
split O -1 1

than O -1 1
one O -1 1

The O -1 1

tasteless, O -1 1
so O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
seafood O -1 1
tagliatelle. O -1 1

Prices B-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
very O -1 3
good. O -1 3

The O -1 0

isn't O -1 0
great(1), O -1 0

the O -1 0

are O -1 0
shipped O -1 0
in O -1 0
from O -1 0
Bruno's O -1 0
down O -1 0
the O -1 0
street, O -1 0
which O -1 0
is O -1 0
not O -1 0

it O -1 0
used O -1 0

from O -1 1
the O -1 1

the O -1 1

but O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
was O -1 1
Thai. O -1 1

I O -1 3
reccomend O -1 3
the O -1 3

the O -1 3
orange B-ASP 2 3
chicken/beef, I-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
fried O -1 3

The O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
delicious O -1 3
(I O -1 3
had O -1 3
a O -1 3
halibut O -1 3
special, O -1 3
my O -1 3
husband O -1 3
had O -1 3
steak), B-ASP 2 3

the O -1 3
service O -1 3
was O -1 3
top-notch. O -1 3

Very O -1 3
romantic O -1 3

- O -1 3
I've O -1 3
literally O -1 3
spent O -1 3
hours O -1 3
at O -1 3

drinking O -1 3
wine B-ASP 2 3
from O -1 3
their O -1 3
extensive O -1 3

and O -1 3
enjoying O -1 3
the O -1 3
ambience. O -1 3

I O -1 0
had O -1 0
to O -1 0
share O -1 0
my O -1 0
table O -1 0
with O -1 0
a O -1 0
loud O -1 0
group O -1 0
of O -1 0
kids O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
rude O -1 0
an O -1 0
unattentive. O -1 0

I O -1 3
had O -1 3
the O -1 3
salmon O -1 3
dish O -1 3
and O -1 3
while O -1 3
it O -1 3
was O -1 3
fine, O -1 3
for O -1 3
the O -1 3
price O -1 3
paid, O -1 3
I O -1 3
expected O -1 3
it O -1 3
to O -1 3
have O -1 3
some O -1 3
type O -1 3
of O -1 3
flavor. B-ASP 0 3

Good(1) O -1 3

all O -1 3
the O -1 3

relatively O -1 3
strict O -1 3
except O -1 3
on O -1 3
Fridays(3). O -1 3

The O -1 3
only O -1 3
concern O -1 3
i O -1 3
have O -1 3
is O -1 3
with O -1 3
the O -1 3
slighly O -1 3
all-business(1) O -1 3
waitstaff O -1 3
who O -1 3
order O -1 3
and O -1 3
throw O -1 3
the O -1 3

down, O -1 3
rushing O -1 3
you O -1 3
out(2). O -1 3

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
weird O -1 1
thing O -1 1
was O -1 1
if O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a(1) O -1 1
bottle, O -1 1
the O -1 1

would O -1 1
have O -1 1
simply O -1 1
multiplied O -1 1
the O -1 1

which O -1 1
makes O -1 1
no O -1 1
sense O -1 1
whatsoever(2). O -1 1

Food B-ASP 1 3
and O -1 3
service O -1 3
was O -1 3
okay. O -1 3

How O -1 4
can O -1 4
they O -1 4
survive O -1 4
serving O -1 4
mediocre(1) O -1 4
food O -1 4
at O -1 4
exorbitant(2) O -1 4
prices?! O -1 4

Forget O -1 3
the(1) O -1 3
rush O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
wait O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
noise O -1 3
(which O -1 3
isn't O -1 3
actually O -1 3
that O -1 3
bad(2)), O -1 3
I O -1 3
mean O -1 3
please, O -1 3
who O -1 3
goes O -1 3
to O -1 3
a O -1 3
steakhouse O -1 3
to O -1 3
be O -1 3

I O -1 3
have O -1 3
been O -1 3
coming O -1 3
here O -1 3
for O -1 3
years O -1 3
and O -1 3
have O -1 3
nothing O -1 3
but O -1 3
good O -1 3
things O -1 3
to O -1 3
say(1) O -1 3
about O -1 3
the O -1 3

and O -1 3
the O -1 3
great(2) O -1 3

The O -1 3

was O -1 3
great. O -1 3

Average(1) O -1 0

are O -1 3
sure O -1 3

Perhaps O -1 1
this O -1 1
food B-ASP 3 1
is O -1 1
considered O -1 1
extreme O -1 1
to O -1 1
an O -1 1
Upper O -1 1

for O -1 1

rest O -1 1
of O -1 1
us O -1 1
who've O -1 1
actually O -1 1
eaten O -1 1
ethnic O -1 1
food, O -1 1
this O -1 1
is O -1 1
simply O -1 1
dull. O -1 1

The O -1 3

is O -1 3
a O -1 3
gorgeous(1), O -1 3
bi-level O -1 3

and O -1 3
the O -1 3
long O -1 3

perfect(2) O -1 3
for B-ASP 1 3
a I-ASP 1 3

I O -1 3
have O -1 3
been O -1 3
going O -1 3
to O -1 3
this O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
for O -1 3
years, O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
past O -1 3
the O -1 3
service B-ASP 1 3
was O -1 3
average(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
inconsistant(2). O -1 3

The O -1 3
staff O -1 3
was O -1 3
accomodating, O -1 3
the O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
absolutely O -1 3
delicious O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
place O -1 3
is O -1 3
lovely. O -1 3

The O -1 3
secret O -1 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
lunch B-ASP 2 3
menu I-ASP 2 3
which O -1 3
offers O -1 3
a O -1 3
complimentary O -1 3
appetizer O -1 3
with O -1 3
every O -1 3
entree O -1 3
ordered. O -1 3

my O -1 0
wife O -1 0
and O -1 0
i O -1 0
have O -1 0
been O -1 0
going O -1 0
to O -1 0
nyc O -1 0
for O -1 0
years O -1 0
and O -1 0
wouldn't O -1 0
miss O -1 0
roxy,s O -1 0
food B-ASP 3 0
is O -1 0
expensive O -1 0
but O -1 0
it's O -1 0
new O -1 0
york! O -1 0

I O -1 0
am O -1 0
not O -1 0
sure O -1 0
if O -1 0
I O -1 0
would O -1 0
call O -1 0
the O -1 0
food B-ASP 1 0
here O -1 0
Indian O -1 0
as O -1 0
it O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
fusion O -1 0
of O -1 0
what O -1 0
seems O -1 0
to O -1 0
be O -1 0
French O -1 0
with O -1 0
an O -1 0
Indian O -1 0
or O -1 0
exotic O -1 0
touch. O -1 0

While O -1 1
certain O -1 1
staples O -1 1
are O -1 1
excellent O -1 1
(the O -1 1
burger, O -1 1
some O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
pastas), O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
is O -1 1
not O -1 1
really O -1 1
the O -1 1
point. O -1 1

And O -1 3
forget O -1 3
what O -1 3
you O -1 3
read O -1 3
under O -1 3
me, O -1 3
the O -1 3
atmosphere B-ASP 1 3
isn't O -1 3
that O -1 3
bad O -1 3
either. O -1 3

Went O -1 3
there O -1 3
and O -1 3
had O -1 3
a O -1 3
combination O -1 3
of O -1 3
different O -1 3
seafood O -1 3
dishes O -1 3
and O -1 3
appetizers. B-ASP 1 3

During O -1 0
the O -1 0
course O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
past O -1 0
3 O -1 0
months, O -1 0
the O -1 0
chef O -1 0
and O -1 0
staff B-ASP 0 0
changed O -1 0
and O -1 0
it O -1 0
was O -1 0
not O -1 0
for O -1 0
the O -1 0
better. O -1 0

To O -1 3
finish O -1 3
off O -1 3
such O -1 3
a O -1 3
delightful O -1 3
dinner O -1 3
experience O -1 3
you O -1 3
must O -1 3
have O -1 3
dessert, B-ASP 2 3

I O -1 0
almost O -1 0
wanted O -1 0
to O -1 0
write O -1 0
a O -1 0
bad O -1 0
review, O -1 0
so O -1 0
no O -1 0
one O -1 0
would O -1 0
ever O -1 0
go O -1 0
here O -1 0
and O -1 0
I O -1 0
could O -1 0
have O -1 0
all O -1 0
the O -1 0
dumplings B-ASP 2 0
to O -1 0
myself! O -1 0

The O -1 3
ambience O -1 3
is O -1 3
very O -1 3
romantic(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
definitely O -1 3
a O -1 3
good(2) O -1 3
place O -1 3
to O -1 3
bring O -1 3
a O -1 3

where O -1 3
the O -1 3
owners B-ASP 2 3
have O -1 3
some O -1 3
imagination O -1 3
and O -1 3
they O -1 3
have O -1 3
actually O -1 3
pulled O -1 3

everything O -1 3

still O -1 3
simple. O -1 3

The O -1 3

I O -1 0

really O -1 0
disappointed O -1 0
ant O -1 0
wanted O -1 0
to O -1 0
tell O -1 0

attentive, O -1 3
beef O -1 3
carpaachio O -1 3
was O -1 3
exellent O -1 3
(huge O -1 3
portion) O -1 3
and O -1 3
pasta O -1 3
was O -1 3
fresh O -1 3

have O -1 3
had O -1 3
in O -1 3
a O -1 3

The O -1 3

great(1) O -1 3
(maybe O -1 3
even O -1 3
borderline O -1 3
nagging O -1 3

at O -1 3

you O -1 3
get O -1 3
attention(2)), O -1 3
the O -1 3

and I-ASP 2 3
the O -1 3
coffee O -1 3

very O -1 3

I O -1 0

that's O -1 3
just O -1 3
my O -1 3
opinion. O -1 3

Mine O -1 3

a O -1 3

The O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
outstanding(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
service O -1 3
was O -1 3
tops(2). O -1 3

night O -1 3
without O -1 3
a O -1 3
reservation, O -1 3
we O -1 3
had O -1 3
to O -1 3
wait O -1 3
at O -1 3
the O -1 3
bar B-ASP 1 3
for O -1 3
a O -1 3
little O -1 3
while, O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
manager O -1 3
was O -1 3
so O -1 3
nice O -1 3
and O -1 3
made O -1 3
our O -1 3
wait O -1 3
a O -1 3
great O -1 3
experience. O -1 3

The O -1 1
portions B-ASP 2 1
are O -1 1
HUGE, O -1 1
so O -1 1
it O -1 1
might O -1 1
be O -1 1
good O -1 1
to O -1 1
order O -1 1
three O -1 1
things O -1 1
to O -1 1
split O -1 1

for O -1 1
two O -1 1

The O -1 1
waitstaff B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
all O -1 1
very O -1 1
busy, O -1 1
it's O -1 1
not O -1 1
outstanding O -1 1
service, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I've O -1 1
never O -1 1
been O -1 1
dealt O -1 1

rudely. O -1 1

We O -1 3
also O -1 3
ordered O -1 3
two O -1 3
hot O -1 3
dogs O -1 3
thinking O -1 3
they O -1 3
would O -1 3
be O -1 3
pretty O -1 3

there O -1 3
is O -1 3

but O -1 3
a O -1 3
far O -1 3
cry O -1 3
from O -1 3
what O -1 3
the O -1 3
name O -1 3
implies. O -1 3

It O -1 2
cannot O -1 2
be(1) O -1 2
the O -1 2
ambience, O -1 2
because O -1 2
the O -1 2
place O -1 2
is O -1 2

some O -1 2

attentive O -1 3
(considering O -1 3
we O -1 3
were O -1 3
the O -1 3
only O -1 3
ones O -1 3
there O -1 3
for O -1 3
the O -1 3
first O -1 3
hour). O -1 3

Besides O -1 1
having O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
been O -1 1
promised O -1 1
given O -1 1
to O -1 1
other O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
patrons O -1 1
twice O -1 1
before O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
actually O -1 1
seated, O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
served O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
three O -1 1
times, O -1 1
received O -1 1
one O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
orders O -1 1
20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
after O -1 1
the O -1 1
rest O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
table B-ASP 0 1
had O -1 1
been O -1 1
served O -1 1
(and O -1 1
that O -1 1
order O -1 1
was O -1 1
undercooked), O -1 1
and O -1 1
charged O -1 1
$45 O -1 1
more O -1 1
than O -1 1
we O -1 1
should O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
on O -1 1
our O -1 1
bill. O -1 1

However, O -1 1
the O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
absolutely O -1 1
horrible. O -1 1

You O -1 1
rarely O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
currys B-ASP 2 1
(masaman, I-ASP 2 1
green, I-ASP 2 1
red) I-ASP 2 1
are O -1 1
full O -1 1
of O -1 1
flavor O -1 1
and O -1 1
come O -1 1
super O -1 1
spicy O -1 1
if O -1 1
you O -1 1
ask O -1 1
for O -1 1
it. O -1 1

The O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
great(1) O -1 3
(big(2) O -1 3
selection, O -1 3
reasonable(3) O -1 3
prices) O -1 3
and I-ASP 2 3
the O -1 3
drinks O -1 3
are O -1 3
really O -1 3
good(4). O -1 3

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
planning O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
dessert O -1 5
but O -1 5
the O -1 5
waitress B-ASP 0 5
basically O -1 5
through O -1 5
the O -1 5
bill O -1 5
at O -1 5
us O -1 5
before O -1 5
we O -1 5
had O -1 5
a O -1 5

The O -1 0

$25 O -1 0

But O -1 3
dinner B-ASP 2 3
here O -1 3
is O -1 3
never O -1 3
disappointing(1), O -1 3
even O -1 3
if O -1 3
the O -1 3

food O -1 0
that O -1 0
will O -1 0
outshine O -1 0
in O -1 0
presentaion, O -1 0
taste, O -1 0
choice, O -1 0
quality O -1 0
and O -1 0
quantity. O -1 0

That O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
problem O -1 0
since O -1 0
we O -1 0
paid O -1 0
about O -1 0
20 O -1 0
bucks O -1 0
a O -1 0
dish, B-ASP 0 0
and O -1 0
had O -1 0
to O -1 0
order O -1 0
5 O -1 0
dishes O -1 0
to O -1 0
get O -1 0
a O -1 0
decent O -1 0
taste. O -1 0

A O -1 0
large O -1 0
is O -1 0
$20, O -1 0
and O -1 0
toppings B-ASP 1 0
are O -1 0
about O -1 0
$3 O -1 0
each. O -1 0

The O -1 0
lamb B-ASP 0 0
meat I-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
under-cooked O -1 0
and O -1 0
EXTRMELY O -1 0
CHEWY. O -1 0

The O -1 0
last O -1 0
two O -1 0
times O -1 0
I O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
from O -1 0
here O -1 0
my O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
soo O -1 0
spicy O -1 0
that O -1 0
I O -1 0
could O -1 0
barely O -1 0
eat O -1 0
it(1), O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
spice O -1 0
took O -1 0
away O -1 0
from(2) O -1 0
the O -1 0
flavor O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
dish. O -1 0

We O -1 0
were O -1 0
told O -1 0
that O -1 0
they O -1 0
were O -1 0
booked O -1 0
solid O -1 0
and O -1 0
no O -1 0
other O -1 0
table B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
available. O -1 0

They O -1 0
couldn't O -1 0
even O -1 0
make O -1 0
a O -1 0
salad B-ASP 0 0
that O -1 0
was O -1 0
appealing. O -1 0

A O -1 0
gentleman, B-ASP 0 0
maybe O -1 0
the O -1 0
manager, O -1 0
came O -1 0
to O -1 0
our O -1 0
table, O -1 0
and O -1 0
without O -1 0
so O -1 0
much O -1 0
as O -1 0
a O -1 0
smile O -1 0
or O -1 0
greeting O -1 0
asked O -1 0
for O -1 0
our O -1 0
order. O -1 0

This O -1 0
place O -1 0
is O -1 0
not O -1 0
worth O -1 0
the O -1 0
prices. B-ASP 0 0

Average(1) O -1 0
to O -1 0
good O -1 0
Thai O -1 0
food, O -1 0
but O -1 0
terrible(2) O -1 0
delivery. O -1 0

And O -1 0
the O -1 0
bill B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
outragous. O -1 0

The O -1 0
miso O -1 0
soup O -1 0
lacked O -1 0
flavor O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
fish B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
unfortunately O -1 0
not O -1 0
as O -1 0
well O -1 0
prepared O -1 0
as O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0
past. O -1 0

EMPTY O -1 0
our O -1 0
entire O -1 0

when O -1 0
we O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
easily O -1 0
spent O -1 0
another O -1 0
$20 O -1 0
on O -1 0
wine. O -1 0

I O -1 0
complained(1) O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
waiter O -1 0
and O -1 0
then O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
manager, O -1 0
but O -1 0
the O -1 0
intensity O -1 0
of O -1 0
rudeness O -1 0
from O -1 0
them O -1 0
just O -1 0
went O -1 0
up(2). O -1 0

The O -1 0
portions B-ASP 0 0
are O -1 0
small(1) O -1 0
but O -1 0
being O -1 0

I O -1 0
almost O -1 0
wanted O -1 0
to O -1 0
write O -1 0
a O -1 0
bad O -1 0
review, O -1 0
so O -1 0
no O -1 0
one O -1 0
would O -1 0
ever O -1 0
go O -1 0
here O -1 0
and O -1 0
I O -1 0
could O -1 0
have O -1 0
all O -1 0
the O -1 0
dumplings B-ASP 2 0
to O -1 0
myself! O -1 0

Had O -1 0
we O -1 0
been O -1 0
stalling O -1 0
I O -1 0
could O -1 0
understand O -1 0
where O -1 0
they O -1 0
were O -1 0
coming O -1 0
from, O -1 0
but O -1 0
we O -1 0
had O -1 0
been O -1 0
there O -1 0
less O -1 0
than O -1 0
an O -1 0
hour O -1 0
and O -1 0
they O -1 0
hadn't O -1 0
even O -1 0
brought O -1 0
us O -1 0
a O -1 0
check B-ASP 0 0
yet! O -1 0

Service B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
also O -1 0
horrible O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
ambience O -1 0
is O -1 0
not O -1 0
that O -1 0
great. O -1 0

The O -1 0
meat B-ASP 1 0
dishes I-ASP 1 0
were O -1 0
only O -1 0
so-so. O -1 0

When O -1 0
we O -1 0
notified O -1 0
him O -1 0
that O -1 0
he O -1 0
didn't O -1 0
mention O -1 0
the O -1 0
specials, B-ASP 1 0
he O -1 0
didn't O -1 0
apologize O -1 0
but O -1 0
let O -1 0
us O -1 0
know O -1 0
that O -1 0
we O -1 0
made O -1 0
a O -1 0
very O -1 0
good O -1 0
decision O -1 0
regardless. O -1 0

The O -1 0
red B-ASP 0 0
curry I-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0
weak O -1 0
and O -1 0
tasteless(1), O -1 0
the O -1 0
pad O -1 0
thai O -1 0
is O -1 0
stuck O -1 0
together O -1 0
and O -1 0
lumpy(2), O -1 0
the O -1 0
rice O -1 0
is O -1 0
often O -1 0
overcooked(3), O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
seafood O -1 0
is O -1 0
pretty O -1 0
sketchy(4). O -1 0

We O -1 0
didn't O -1 0
know O -1 0
if O -1 0
we O -1 0
should O -1 0
order O -1 0
a O -1 0
drink B-ASP 1 0
or O -1 0
leave? O -1 0

The O -1 0
food O -1 0
came O -1 0
out O -1 0
wrong(1), O -1 0
the O -1 0
waiter O -1 0
was O -1 0
no O -1 0
where O -1 0
to O -1 0
be O -1 0
found(2) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
wine O -1 0
showed O -1 0
up O -1 0
at O -1 0
the O -1 0
end(3) O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
meal. O -1 0

The O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
bad(1), O -1 0
the O -1 0
food O -1 0
took O -1 0
to O -1 0
forever O -1 0
to O -1 0
come(2), O -1 0
we O -1 0
sat O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
upper O -1 0
level. O -1 0

i O -1 0
would O -1 0
just O -1 0
ask O -1 0
for O -1 0
no O -1 0
oil B-ASP 0 0
next O -1 0
time. O -1 0

During O -1 0
the O -1 0
course O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
past O -1 0
3 O -1 0
months, O -1 0
the O -1 0
chef O -1 0
and O -1 0
staff B-ASP 0 0
changed O -1 0
and O -1 0
it O -1 0
was O -1 0
not O -1 0
for O -1 0
the O -1 0
better. O -1 0

It O -1 0
was O -1 0
like O -1 0
the O -1 0
servers B-ASP 0 0
forgot O -1 0
that O -1 0
they O -1 0
actually O -1 0
worked O -1 0
there O -1 0
and O -1 0
instead O -1 0
wanted O -1 0
to O -1 0
hang O -1 0
out O -1 0
and O -1 0
be O -1 0
cool. O -1 0

Ambiance O -1 0
is O -1 0
barely O -1 0
romantic(1) O -1 0
but O -1 0
management O -1 0
tries(2). O -1 0

We O -1 0
were O -1 0
seated O -1 0
promptly O -1 0
in O -1 0
close O -1 0
proximity O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
dance B-ASP 1 0
floor. I-ASP 1 0

the O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
mediocre O -1 0
to O -1 0
be O -1 0
kind(1) O -1 0
- O -1 0
the O -1 0
interior O -1 0
is O -1 0
small O -1 0
and O -1 0
average(2) O -1 0
- O -1 0
the I-ASP 0 0
owners O -1 0
are O -1 0
a O -1 0
tag-team O -1 0
of O -1 0
unpleasantries O -1 0
- O -1 0
so O -1 0
rude O -1 0
and O -1 0
snotty(3) O -1 0
i O -1 0
actually O -1 0
let O -1 0
out O -1 0
a O -1 0
hearty O -1 0
guffaw O -1 0
whilst(4) O -1 0

I O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
from O -1 0
here O -1 0
my O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0

that O -1 0
I O -1 0
could O -1 0
barely O -1 0
eat O -1 0
it(1), O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0

terrible O -1 0

The O -1 0

Two O -1 0
complaints(1)- O -1 0
their O -1 0
appetizer O -1 0

stinks, O -1 0
it O -1 0
would O -1 0

Though O -1 0
the O -1 0

may O -1 0
look O -1 0
like O -1 0
a O -1 0
challenge O -1 0

soft O -1 0

crab I-ASP 2 0
hanging O -1 0
out O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0

it O -1 0

the O -1 0

you O -1 0
pay O -1 0
for O -1 0

The O -1 0

I O -1 0
have O -1 0
been O -1 0
going O -1 0
to O -1 0
this O -1 0
restaurant O -1 0
for O -1 0
years, O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0
past O -1 0
the O -1 0
service O -1 0
was O -1 0
average(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
food O -1 0
inconsistant(2). O -1 0

Only O -1 0
drawback O -1 0
- O -1 0
they O -1 0
won't O -1 0
toast O -1 0
your O -1 0
bagel, O -1 0
and O -1 0
they O -1 0
don't O -1 0
make O -1 0
eggs O -1 0
for O -1 0
the O -1 0
bagel. B-ASP 0 0

As O -1 0
far O -1 0
as O -1 0
the O -1 0
service B-ASP 3 0
goes, O -1 0
the O -1 0
waitresses O -1 0
were O -1 0
not O -1 0
particularly O -1 0
friendly, O -1 0
but O -1 0
they O -1 0
got O -1 0
the O -1 0
job O -1 0
done. O -1 0

Our O -1 0

The O -1 0

was O -1 0
lousy O -1 0
- O -1 0
too O -1 0
sweet O -1 0

too O -1 0

the O -1 0

tiny. O -1 0

Everytime O -1 0

I O -1 0
can't O -1 0
pick O -1 0
anything O -1 0

and O -1 0
not O -1 0
because O -1 0
the O -1 0

is O -1 0
filled O -1 0
with O -1 0
great O -1 0
things O -1 0

I O -1 0

of O -1 0
the O -1 0
meal(7). O -1 0

As O -1 0
we O -1 0
were O -1 0
sitting O -1 0
eating O -1 0
the O -1 0
subpar O -1 0
food O -1 0
the O -1 0
manager O -1 0
proceeded O -1 0
to O -1 0
berate O -1 0
a O -1 0
couple O -1 0
of O -1 0
his O -1 0
employees B-ASP 0 0
for O -1 0
putting O -1 0
out O -1 0
the O -1 0
wrong O -1 0
containers O -1 0
for O -1 0
condiments O -1 0
and O -1 0
explained O -1 0
to O -1 0
them O -1 0
how O -1 0
expensive O -1 0
these O -1 0
containers O -1 0
were. O -1 0

The O -1 0
food B-ASP 0 0
arrived O -1 0
20 O -1 0
minutes O -1 0
after O -1 0
I O -1 0
called, O -1 0
cold O -1 0
and O -1 0
soggy. O -1 0

And O -1 0
the O -1 0
bill B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
outragous. O -1 0

At O -1 0
peak O -1 0
times, O -1 0
the O -1 0
restaurant O -1 0
is O -1 0
overcrowded O -1 0
and O -1 0
tables B-ASP 0 0
are O -1 0
uncomfortably O -1 0
close. O -1 0

The O -1 0
sandwiches B-ASP 0 0
are O -1 0
dry, O -1 0
tasteless O -1 0
and O -1 0
way O -1 0
overpriced. O -1 0

But O -1 0
make O -1 0
sure O -1 0
you O -1 0
have O -1 0
enough O -1 0
room O -1 0
on O -1 0
your O -1 0
credit O -1 0
card O -1 0
as O -1 0
the O -1 0
bill B-ASP 0 0
will O -1 0
leave O -1 0
a O -1 0
big O -1 0
dent O -1 0
in O -1 0
your O -1 0
wallet. O -1 0

The O -1 0
miso B-ASP 0 0
soup I-ASP 0 0
lacked O -1 0
flavor O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
fish O -1 0
was O -1 0
unfortunately O -1 0
not O -1 0
as O -1 0
well O -1 0
prepared O -1 0
as O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0
past. O -1 0

I O -1 0
almost O -1 0
wanted O -1 0
to O -1 0
write O -1 0
a O -1 0
bad O -1 0
review, O -1 0
so O -1 0
no O -1 0
one O -1 0
would O -1 0
ever O -1 0
go O -1 0
here O -1 0
and O -1 0
I O -1 0
could O -1 0
have O -1 0
all O -1 0
the O -1 0
dumplings B-ASP 2 0
to O -1 0
myself! O -1 0

We O -1 0
didn't O -1 0
know O -1 0
if O -1 0
we O -1 0
should O -1 0
order O -1 0
a O -1 0

or O -1 0
leave? O -1 0

many O -1 0

on O -1 0
the O -1 0

I O -1 0

absurdly O -1 0

who O -1 0
don't O -1 0

they O -1 0
work O -1 0
at O -1 0
a O -1 0
glorified O -1 0

clumsy O -1 0
service, B-ASP 0 0
and O -1 0
management O -1 0
that O -1 0
doesn't O -1 0
care. O -1 0

Though O -1 0
you O -1 0
will O -1 0
undoubtedly O -1 0
be O -1 0
seated(1) O -1 0
at O -1 0
a O -1 0

with O -1 0
what O -1 0

the O -1 0
warm(3) I-ASP 2 0

you'll O -1 0
have O -1 0
fun O -1 0
and O -1 0
forgot O -1 0
about O -1 0
the O -1 0
tight(4) O -1 0
spot O -1 0
you're O -1 0
in. O -1 0

The O -1 0
fish B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
not O -1 0
fresh(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
rice O -1 0
tasted O -1 0
old O -1 0
and O -1 0
stale(2). O -1 0

The O -1 0
man O -1 0
that O -1 0
was O -1 0
hosting O -1 0
promised O -1 0
to O -1 0
save O -1 0
a O -1 0
table B-ASP 1 0
for O -1 0
our O -1 0
party O -1 0
of O -1 0

then O -1 0
sat O -1 0
a O -1 0
party O -1 0
of O -1 0
2 O -1 0
at O -1 0
the O -1 0
very O -1 0

while O -1 0
there O -1 0
were O -1 0

Orsay, O -1 0

a O -1 0
very O -1 0
pleasnt O -1 0
throw O -1 0
back O -1 0

traditional O -1 0
French O -1 0
food, O -1 0
and O -1 0
French O -1 0
service B-ASP 2 0
as O -1 0
well. O -1 0

The O -1 0
menu O -1 0
prices O -1 0
are O -1 0
a O -1 0
bit O -1 0
expensive O -1 0
for O -1 0
what O -1 0
you O -1 0
get O -1 0
in O -1 0
quality O -1 0
and O -1 0
portion B-ASP 0 0

Service O -1 0
is O -1 0
highly O -1 0
refined: O -1 0
our O -1 0
seating O -1 0
was O -1 0
delayed O -1 0
35 O -1 0
minutes O -1 0
past O -1 0
our O -1 0
reservation B-ASP 0 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
maitre O -1 0
d' O -1 0
apologized O -1 0
and O -1 0
regularly O -1 0
kept O -1 0
us O -1 0
apprised O -1 0
of O -1 0
progress. O -1 0

" O -1 0
The O -1 0
menu O -1 0
includes O -1 0
pub O -1 0
fare--burgers, O -1 0
steaks O -1 0
and O -1 0
shepherds O -1 0
pie--and O -1 0
even O -1 0
a O -1 0
portabella O -1 0
lasagna O -1 0
for O -1 0
those O -1 0
black O -1 0
sheep O -1 0
known O -1 0
as O -1 0
"vegetarians. O -1 0

Consequently, O -1 0
their O -1 0
burgers B-ASP 0 0
fell O -1 0
apart O -1 0
in O -1 0
their O -1 0
hands O -1 0
and O -1 0
made O -1 0
such O -1 0
a O -1 0
mess O -1 0
that O -1 0
they O -1 0
did'nt O -1 0
feel O -1 0
like O -1 0
finishing O -1 0
them. O -1 0

They O -1 0
came O -1 0
out O -1 0
over O -1 0
cooked O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
cheese B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
almost O -1 0
non O -1 0
existant. O -1 0

Cuisine O -1 0
is O -1 0
billed O -1 0
as O -1 0
asian O -1 0
fusion O -1 0
- O -1 0
doesn't O -1 0
meet O -1 0
the O -1 0
bill. B-ASP 0 0

The O -1 0
food O -1 0
at O -1 0
this O -1 0
place O -1 0
is O -1 0
'gourmet' I-ASP 1 0
Indian I-ASP 1 0
cuisine. I-ASP 1 0

The O -1 0
price O -1 0
is O -1 0
reasonable O -1 0
although O -1 0
the O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0
poor. O -1 0

sometimes O -1 0
i O -1 0
get O -1 0
bad O -1 0
food O -1 0
and O -1 0
bad O -1 0
service, B-ASP 0 0
sometimes O -1 0
i O -1 0

then O -1 0
we O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
a O -1 0
dinosaur O -1 0
rolls O -1 0
and O -1 0
white B-ASP 1 0

This O -1 0
wasn't O -1 0
the O -1 0
expected(1) O -1 0
menu O -1 0
comprised O -1 0
only O -1 0
of B-ASP 1 0
pad I-ASP 1 0
thai O -1 0
and O -1 0
tom O -1 0
yum O -1 0
soup, O -1 0
but O -1 0
I O -1 0
thought O -1 0
that O -1 0
was O -1 0
what O -1 0
made O -1 0
the O -1 0
place O -1 0
so O -1 0
special(2). O -1 0

Had O -1 0
we O -1 0
been O -1 0
stalling O -1 0
I O -1 0
could O -1 0
understand O -1 0
where O -1 0
they O -1 0
were O -1 0
coming O -1 0
from, O -1 0
but O -1 0
we O -1 0
had O -1 0
been O -1 0
there O -1 0
less O -1 0
than O -1 0
an O -1 0
hour O -1 0
and O -1 0
they O -1 0
hadn't O -1 0
even O -1 0
brought O -1 0
us O -1 0
a O -1 0
check B-ASP 0 0
yet! O -1 0

The O -1 0
service O -1 0
is O -1 0
always O -1 0
bad O -1 0
though, O -1 0
don't O -1 0
expect O -1 0
much O -1 0
of O -1 0
anything(1) O -1 0
from O -1 0
your O -1 0
server, O -1 0
and O -1 0
I O -1 0
would O -1 0
not O -1 0
recommend O -1 0
bringing O -1 0
a O -1 0

Would O -1 0

asking(1) O -1 0
the O -1 0

we O -1 0
did O -1 0
notice O -1 0
however, O -1 0
that O -1 0
some O -1 0
tables O -1 0
had O -1 0
what O -1 0
looked O -1 0
like O -1 0
pita O -1 0
instead O -1 0
of O -1 0

The O -1 0
service O -1 0
was O -1 0
pretty O -1 0
poor O -1 0
all O -1 0

the O -1 0

the(2) O -1 0

it. O -1 0

We O -1 0

we O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
trouble O -1 0
getting O -1 0

but O -1 0
somehow O -1 0

The O -1 0
room B-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
little O -1 0
plain(1), O -1 0
but O -1 0
it's O -1 0
difficult O -1 0
to O -1 0
make O -1 0
such O -1 0
a O -1 0
small(2) O -1 0
place O -1 0
exciting O -1 0
and O -1 0
I O -1 0
would O -1 0
not O -1 0
suggest O -1 0
that O -1 0
as O -1 0
a O -1 0
reason O -1 0
not O -1 0
to O -1 0
go. O -1 0

They O -1 0
were O -1 0
very O -1 0
abrupt O -1 0
with O -1 0
me O -1 0
when O -1 0
I O -1 0
called(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
actually O -1 0
claimed O -1 0
the O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
late O -1 0
because O -1 0
they O -1 0
were O -1 0
out(2) O -1 0
of O -1 0
rice. O -1 0

The O -1 0
most O -1 0
annoying O -1 0
thing, O -1 0
though, O -1 0
is O -1 0
the O -1 0
fact O -1 0
that O -1 0
the O -1 0
servers B-ASP 0 0
seem O -1 0
to O -1 0

My O -1 0

The O -1 0

But O -1 0
the O -1 0
main O -1 0
hit O -1 0
was O -1 0
the O -1 0

the O -1 0

it O -1 0
just O -1 0
is O -1 0
not O -1 0
THAT O -1 0
great. O -1 0

the O -1 0
real O -1 0
kicker O -1 0
of O -1 0

nothingon O -1 0
the O -1 0

The O -1 0

While O -1 0

lack O -1 0

you O -1 0

feeling O -1 0
like O -1 0
you O -1 0
missed O -1 0

with O -1 0
the O -1 0

The O -1 0
worst O -1 0

for O -1 0
Japanese B-ASP 0 0

I O -1 0
love O -1 0

as O -1 0
anyone O -1 0
else(1) O -1 0
who O -1 0
has O -1 0
written O -1 0

must O -1 0

anyone O -1 0
from O -1 0
visiting O -1 0
the O -1 0
Grand O -1 0

two I-ASP 0 0

And O -1 0
I O -1 0
say O -1 0
snacking O -1 0
because O -1 0
it O -1 0
really O -1 0

not O -1 0

The O -1 0

was O -1 0
a O -1 0
bit O -1 0
slow(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
portions O -1 0
are O -1 0
a O -1 0

if O -1 0
you O -1 0
are O -1 0
hungry O -1 0
and O -1 0
in O -1 0
a O -1 0
rush, O -1 0
this O -1 0

not O -1 0
the O -1 0

Ambiance O -1 0
is O -1 0
barely O -1 0

imagine O -1 0
how O -1 0

it O -1 0
we O -1 0
only O -1 0
had O -1 0

The O -1 0
Halibut B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
too O -1 0
salty, O -1 0
dessert O -1 0
was O -1 0
so O -1 0
so O -1 0
(don't O -1 0
waste O -1 0
any O -1 0
of O -1 0
your O -1 0
calories) O -1 0
and O -1 0
service O -1 0
was O -1 0
poor. O -1 0

We O -1 0

one O -1 0

we O -1 0
thoroughly O -1 0

it O -1 0

for O -1 0
the O -1 0

I O -1 0
asked O -1 0
repeatedly O -1 0
what O -1 0
the O -1 0
status(1) O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
meal O -1 0
was O -1 0
and O -1 0
was O -1 0
pretty O -1 0
much O -1 0
grunted O -1 0
at O -1 0
by O -1 0
the O -1 0

waiter. O -1 0

Since O -1 0
my O -1 0
first O -1 0

I O -1 0
have O -1 0
had O -1 0
the O -1 0
chance O -1 0
to O -1 0
have O -1 0
brunch O -1 0
at O -1 0
Orsay O -1 0
3x. O -1 0

Two O -1 0
complaints(1)- O -1 0
their O -1 0
appetizer O -1 0
selection O -1 0
stinks, O -1 0
it O -1 0
would O -1 0
be O -1 0
nice O -1 0
to O -1 0
get O -1 0
some(2) O -1 0
mozzarella O -1 0
sticks O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
menu. O -1 0

And O -1 0
the O -1 0
bill B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
outragous. O -1 0

INCREDIBLY O -1 0

I O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
a O -1 0
Chicken O -1 0
Teriyaki O -1 0
dish O -1 0
and O -1 0
found O -1 0
that O -1 0
the O -1 0

extremely O -1 0

The O -1 0

had O -1 0
like O -1 0
6 O -1 0
pieces O -1 0
of O -1 0

in O -1 0
it. O -1 0

We O -1 0

we O -1 0
buy O -1 0

hot O -1 0
and O -1 0
then O -1 0
to O -1 0
freeze O -1 0
(they O -1 0
told O -1 0
me O -1 0
that O -1 0
if O -1 0
I O -1 0
call O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0

they'd O -1 0
bring O -1 0
it O -1 0
out O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0

so O -1 0
I O -1 0
wouldn't O -1 0
have O -1 0
to O -1 0
look O -1 0
for O -1 0
parking). O -1 0

The O -1 0
lack O -1 0
of O -1 0
AC B-ASP 0 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
fact O -1 0
that O -1 0
there O -1 0
are O -1 0
a O -1 0
million O -1 0
swarming O -1 0
bodies O -1 0
(although O -1 0
everyone O -1 0
is O -1 0

no O -1 0

The O -1 0
unfortunate O -1 0
lady O -1 0
next O -1 0
to O -1 0
us O -1 0
thought O -1 0
she O -1 0
had O -1 0
ordered(1) O -1 0
a I-ASP 1 0
salad O -1 0
(including O -1 0
asking O -1 0
for O -1 0

and O -1 0
was O -1 0
instead O -1 0
given(2) O -1 0
a O -1 0
quesedilla. O -1 0

To O -1 0
my O -1 0
right, O -1 0
the O -1 0
hostess B-ASP 0 0
stood O -1 0
over(1) O -1 0
a O -1 0
busboy O -1 0
and O -1 0
hissed O -1 0
rapido, O -1 0
rapido O -1 0
as O -1 0
he O -1 0
tried O -1 0
to O -1 0
clear O -1 0
and O -1 0
re-set(2) O -1 0
a O -1 0

Yes O -1 0
you O -1 0
have O -1 0
to(1) O -1 0
wait O -1 0
to O -1 0
be O -1 0

the O -1 0

I O -1 0
went O -1 0
with O -1 0
5 O -1 0
friends O -1 0
and O -1 0
we O -1 0
lingered O -1 0
at O -1 0
the O -1 0
table O -1 0
for O -1 0
a O -1 0
bit O -1 0
and O -1 0
didn't O -1 0

I O -1 0
don't O -1 0

absurdly O -1 0

who O -1 0
don't O -1 0
recognize O -1 0
they O -1 0
work O -1 0
at O -1 0
a O -1 0
glorified O -1 0
diner, O -1 0
clumsy O -1 0
service, B-ASP 0 0
and O -1 0
management O -1 0
that O -1 0
doesn't O -1 0
care. O -1 0

The O -1 0
owner O -1 0
and O -1 0
staff O -1 0
are O -1 0
all O -1 0
Japanese O -1 0
as O -1 0
well O -1 0
and O -1 0
that O -1 0
adds O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
entire O -1 0
ambiance. B-ASP 2 0

Yes O -1 0
you O -1 0
have O -1 0
to(1) O -1 0
wait O -1 0
to O -1 0

the O -1 0

all O -1 0

Everytime O -1 0
I O -1 0
go O -1 0
there O -1 0
I O -1 0
can't O -1 0
pick O -1 0
anything O -1 0
to O -1 0
eat O -1 0
and O -1 0
not O -1 0
because O -1 0
the O -1 0
menu B-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0
filled O -1 0
with O -1 0
great O -1 0
things O -1 0
to O -1 0

The O -1 0
dim B-ASP 1 0
sum I-ASP 1 0
here O -1 0
is O -1 0
only O -1 0
so-so. O -1 0

Our O -1 0
waitress B-ASP 0 0
had O -1 0
apparently O -1 0
never O -1 0
tried O -1 0
any O -1 0
of O -1 0

and O -1 0
there O -1 0
was O -1 0
no O -1 0

any O -1 0

Service O -1 0
is O -1 0
highly O -1 0

our O -1 0

was O -1 0
delayed O -1 0
35 O -1 0

past O -1 0

and O -1 0
the O -1 0

apologized O -1 0

The O -1 0
decor O -1 0
in O -1 0
this O -1 0
place O -1 0
is O -1 0
very O -1 0
diner-ish(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
kind O -1 0
of B-ASP 2 0
place O -1 0
you O -1 0
expect O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0
East O -1 0
Village O -1 0
- O -1 0
not O -1 0
romantic, O -1 0
just O -1 0
simple, O -1 0
small O -1 0
and O -1 0
sparse(2). O -1 0

we O -1 0
did O -1 0
notice O -1 0
however, O -1 0
that O -1 0
some O -1 0
tables O -1 0
had O -1 0
what O -1 0
looked O -1 0
like O -1 0
pita O -1 0
instead O -1 0
of O -1 0
naan. B-ASP 0 0

The O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
poor, O -1 0
restaurant O -1 0
poorly O -1 0
lit, O -1 0
staff O -1 0
not O -1 0
very O -1 0
attentive O -1 0
and O -1 0
I O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
rather O -1 0
eaten O -1 0
at O -1 0
a O -1 0
Mcdonald's O -1 0
than O -1 0
this O -1 0
joint. O -1 0

Besides, O -1 0
when O -1 0
you O -1 0
have O -1 0
bad(1) O -1 0
service, O -1 0
that's O -1 0
less(2) O -1 0

you O -1 0
have O -1 0

tip. O -1 0

I O -1 0

the O -1 0

that O -1 0

curry I-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0
weak O -1 0
and O -1 0
tasteless(1), O -1 0
the O -1 0
pad O -1 0
thai O -1 0
is O -1 0
stuck O -1 0
together O -1 0
and O -1 0
lumpy(2), O -1 0
the O -1 0
rice O -1 0
is O -1 0
often O -1 0
overcooked(3), O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
seafood O -1 0
is O -1 0
pretty O -1 0
sketchy(4). O -1 0

The O -1 0
waiters B-ASP 0 0
ALWAYS O -1 0
look O -1 0
angry O -1 0
and O -1 0
even O -1 0
ignore O -1 0
their O -1 0
high-tipping O -1 0
regulars. O -1 0

The O -1 0
hostess B-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0
rude O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
point O -1 0
of O -1 0
being O -1 0
offensive. O -1 0

Also, O -1 0
don't O -1 0
plan O -1 0
on O -1 0
asking O -1 0
for O -1 0
your O -1 0
favorite O -1 0
roll, B-ASP 0 0
if O -1 0
it's O -1 0
not O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
menu, O -1 0
you O -1 0
can't O -1 0
have O -1 0
it. O -1 0

Likewise O -1 0
if O -1 0
you O -1 0
like O -1 0
really O -1 0
thin O -1 0
crust O -1 0
or O -1 0
really O -1 0
big O -1 0
slices B-ASP 0 0
then O -1 0
Nick O -1 0
and O -1 0
Joe's O -1 0
may O -1 0
not O -1 0
be O -1 0
your O -1 0

The O -1 0
man B-ASP 0 0
that O -1 0
was O -1 0
hosting O -1 0
promised O -1 0
to O -1 0
save O -1 0
a O -1 0
table O -1 0
for O -1 0
our O -1 0
party O -1 0
of O -1 0
7, O -1 0
then O -1 0
sat O -1 0
a O -1 0
party O -1 0
of O -1 0
2 O -1 0
at O -1 0
the O -1 0
very O -1 0
table O -1 0
he O -1 0
was O -1 0
saving O -1 0
(mean O -1 0
while O -1 0
there O -1 0
were O -1 0
boths O -1 0
open O -1 0
all O -1 0
around). O -1 0

The O -1 0
mussaman B-ASP 0 0
curry I-ASP 0 0
that O -1 0
I O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
was O -1 0
as O -1 0
thin O -1 0
as O -1 0
water(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
aside O -1 0
from O -1 0
the O -1 0
poorly(2) O -1 0
fried O -1 0
tofu O -1 0
that O -1 0
I O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
in O -1 0
it, O -1 0
they O -1 0
graciously O -1 0
provided O -1 0
me O -1 0
with O -1 0
ONE O -1 0
piece O -1 0
of O -1 0
poorly O -1 0
cooked(3) O -1 0
potato. O -1 0

The O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
bad(1), O -1 0
the O -1 0
food O -1 0
took O -1 0
to O -1 0
forever O -1 0
to O -1 0
come(2), O -1 0
we O -1 0
sat O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
upper O -1 0
level. O -1 0

I O -1 0
had O -1 0
the O -1 0
tuna O -1 0
tartare O -1 0
with O -1 0
sake, B-ASP 2 0
mushroom O -1 0
ravioli O -1 0
with O -1 0
pinot O -1 0
noir, O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
chocolate O -1 0
sampler O -1 0
with O -1 0
a O -1 0
dessert O -1 0
wine O -1 0
for O -1 0
$49. O -1 0

They O -1 0
offer O -1 0
the O -1 0
same O -1 0
menu O -1 0
but O -1 0
have O -1 0
creative(1) O -1 0
drinks O -1 0
that O -1 0
are O -1 0
loaded O -1 0
with O -1 0
alcohol O -1 0
and O -1 0
cheeky O -1 0
names O -1 0
-- O -1 0
but O -1 0
they O -1 0
do O -1 0
cost O -1 0
you(2). O -1 0

Dieters O -1 0
stick O -1 0
to O -1 0
salads B-ASP 2 0
or O -1 0
indulge O -1 0
in O -1 0
vegetarian O -1 0
platters. O -1 0

So O -1 0
we O -1 0
sat O -1 0
at O -1 0
the O -1 0
bar, O -1 0
the O -1 0
bartender B-ASP 0 0
didn't O -1 0
seem O -1 0
like O -1 0
he O -1 0
wanted O -1 0
to O -1 0
be O -1 0
there. O -1 0

That O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
problem O -1 0
since O -1 0
we O -1 0
paid O -1 0
about O -1 0
20 O -1 0
bucks O -1 0
a O -1 0
dish, O -1 0
and O -1 0
had O -1 0
to O -1 0
order O -1 0
5 O -1 0
dishes B-ASP 0 0
to O -1 0
get O -1 0
a O -1 0
decent O -1 0
taste. O -1 0

We O -1 0
live O -1 0
in O -1 0
New O -1 0
Jersey O -1 0
and O -1 0
whenever O -1 0
we O -1 0
go O -1 0
into O -1 0
New O -1 0
York O -1 0
City O -1 0
we O -1 0
buy O -1 0
bagels B-ASP 1 0
to O -1 0
eat O -1 0
hot O -1 0
and O -1 0
then O -1 0
to O -1 0
freeze O -1 0
(they O -1 0
told O -1 0
me O -1 0
that O -1 0
if O -1 0
I O -1 0
call O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0
order, O -1 0
they'd O -1 0
bring O -1 0
it O -1 0
out O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
car O -1 0
so O -1 0
I O -1 0
wouldn't O -1 0
have O -1 0
to O -1 0
look O -1 0
for O -1 0
parking). O -1 0

I O -1 0
need O -1 0
at O -1 0
least O -1 0
three O -1 0
rolls B-ASP 1 0
to O -1 0
be O -1 0
full, O -1 0
and O -1 0
that's O -1 0
at O -1 0
least O -1 0
$14.00! O -1 0

I O -1 0
asked O -1 0
repeatedly O -1 0
what O -1 0
the O -1 0
status(1) O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
meal O -1 0
was O -1 0
and O -1 0
was O -1 0
pretty O -1 0
much O -1 0
grunted O -1 0
at O -1 0
by O -1 0
the O -1 0
unbelievably O -1 0
rude(2) O -1 0
waiter. O -1 0

And O -1 0
their O -1 0
prices O -1 0
are O -1 0
very O -1 0
high(1) O -1 0
- O -1 0
they O -1 0
actually O -1 0
think O -1 0
that O -1 0
they O -1 0
can O -1 0
get O -1 0
away O -1 0
with O -1 0

such(2) O -1 0
prices O -1 0
for O -1 0

a O -1 0
bad O -1 0
idea. O -1 0

While O -1 0
the O -1 0

Kind O -1 0
of O -1 0

I O -1 0
guess O -1 0
if O -1 0
they O -1 0
are O -1 0
not O -1 0

might O -1 0
be O -1 0

And O -1 0
their O -1 0

are O -1 0
very O -1 0
high(1) O -1 0
- O -1 0
they O -1 0
actually O -1 0

that O -1 0
they O -1 0

get O -1 0

such(2) O -1 0

Service O -1 0

can't O -1 0
pick O -1 0
anything O -1 0

Maybe O -1 0
I O -1 0
say O -1 0
so O -1 0
because O -1 0
it O -1 0

First, O -1 0
the O -1 0
waiter O -1 0
who O -1 0
served B-ASP 0 0
us O -1 0
neglected O -1 0
to O -1 0
fill O -1 0
us O -1 0
in O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
specials, O -1 0
which O -1 0
I O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
chosen O -1 0
had O -1 0
I O -1 0
known O -1 0
about O -1 0
them. O -1 0

I O -1 0
asked O -1 0
repeatedly O -1 0
what O -1 0
the O -1 0
status(1) O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
meal O -1 0
was O -1 0
and O -1 0
was O -1 0
pretty O -1 0
much O -1 0
grunted O -1 0
at O -1 0
by O -1 0
the O -1 0
unbelievably O -1 0
rude(2) O -1 0
waiter. O -1 0

The O -1 0
downstairs B-ASP 2 0
bar I-ASP 2 0
scene I-ASP 2 0
is O -1 0
very O -1 0
cool O -1 0
and O -1 0
chill... O -1 0

My O -1 0
chicken O -1 0
was O -1 0
completely O -1 0
dried O -1 0
out O -1 0
and O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
cold O -1 0
side(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
sauce O -1 0
was O -1 0
not O -1 0
very O -1 0
flavorful(2). O -1 0

Because O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
delicate O -1 0
thin(1) O -1 0
crust, O -1 0
take-out O -1 0
pies O -1 0
get O -1 0
soggy O -1 0
in O -1 0
their O -1 0
boxes(2). O -1 0

Then O -1 0
they O -1 0
somehow O -1 0
made O -1 0
a O -1 0
dry O -1 0
and O -1 0
burnt O -1 0
crust, B-ASP 0 0
around O -1 0
a O -1 0
raw O -1 0
and O -1 0
cold O -1 0
inside. O -1 0

the O -1 0
two O -1 0
waitress's B-ASP 0 0
looked O -1 0
like O -1 0
they O -1 0
had O -1 0
been O -1 0
sucking O -1 0

The O -1 0

the I-ASP 0 0
udon I-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
soy O -1 0

and O -1 0

I O -1 0
am O -1 0
not O -1 0
sure O -1 0
if O -1 0
I O -1 0
would O -1 0
call O -1 0
the O -1 0
food B-ASP 1 0
here O -1 0
Indian O -1 0
as O -1 0
it O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
fusion O -1 0
of O -1 0
what O -1 0
seems O -1 0
to O -1 0
be O -1 0
French O -1 0
with O -1 0
an O -1 0
Indian O -1 0
or O -1 0
exotic O -1 0
touch. O -1 0

The O -1 0
hot O -1 0
and O -1 0
sour(1) O -1 0
soup O -1 0
was O -1 0
unbearably O -1 0
hot O -1 0
and O -1 0
tasted O -1 0
of O -1 0
only(2) O -1 0
pepper O -1 0
and O -1 0
nothing O -1 0
else. O -1 0

It O -1 0
is O -1 0
far O -1 0
more O -1 0
popular O -1 0
as(1) O -1 0
a O -1 0
bar O -1 0
than O -1 0
as O -1 0
a O -1 0
restaurant, O -1 0
with O -1 0
only O -1 0
a O -1 0
few(2) O -1 0

and O -1 0
the I-ASP 1 0
waiter O -1 0
being O -1 0
the O -1 0
bartender, O -1 0
but O -1 0
we O -1 0
greatly O -1 0
enjoyed O -1 0
the O -1 0
unobtrusive(3) O -1 0
atmosphere. O -1 0

You O -1 0
have O -1 0
to O -1 0
increase O -1 0
the O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
a O -1 0
lot. O -1 0

last O -1 0
Tuesday O -1 0
for O -1 0
a O -1 0
late B-ASP 1 0
lunch I-ASP 1 0
with O -1 0
a O -1 0
friend. O -1 0

As O -1 0
we O -1 0
were O -1 0
sitting O -1 0
eating O -1 0
the O -1 0
subpar O -1 0
food O -1 0
the O -1 0
manager B-ASP 0 0
proceeded O -1 0
to O -1 0
berate O -1 0
a O -1 0
couple O -1 0
of O -1 0
his O -1 0
employees O -1 0
for O -1 0
putting O -1 0
out O -1 0
the O -1 0
wrong O -1 0
containers O -1 0
for O -1 0
condiments O -1 0
and O -1 0
explained O -1 0
to O -1 0
them O -1 0
how O -1 0
expensive O -1 0
these O -1 0
containers O -1 0
were. O -1 0

The O -1 0
price O -1 0
is O -1 0
reasonable O -1 0
although O -1 0
the O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0
poor. O -1 0

Overall O -1 0
a O -1 0
disappointing O -1 0
experience O -1 0
for O -1 0
that O -1 0
price B-ASP 0 0
category. O -1 0

The O -1 0
last O -1 0
time O -1 0
I O -1 0
went O -1 0
we O -1 0
were O -1 0
seated O -1 0
at O -1 0
a O -1 0
table B-ASP 0 0
in O -1 0
a O -1 0
corridor O -1 0
next O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
kitchen. O -1 0

Also, O -1 0
don't O -1 0
plan O -1 0
on O -1 0
asking O -1 0
for O -1 0
your O -1 0
favorite O -1 0
roll, O -1 0
if O -1 0
it's O -1 0
not O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
menu, B-ASP 0 0
you O -1 0
can't O -1 0
have O -1 0
it. O -1 0

Furthermore, O -1 0
the O -1 0
rice B-ASP 0 0
had O -1 0
no(1) O -1 0
seasoning, O -1 0
so O -1 0
the O -1 0
sushi O -1 0
was O -1 0
bland O -1 0
and O -1 0
disgusting(2). O -1 0

Our O -1 0
first O -1 0
time O -1 0
in O -1 0
New O -1 0
York O -1 0
and O -1 0
we O -1 0
had O -1 0
to O -1 0
try O -1 0
a O -1 0

They O -1 0
had O -1 0
scrapped O -1 0
the O -1 0

the O -1 0

they O -1 0
make(1) O -1 0

BOWL. O -1 0

The O -1 0
man B-ASP 0 0
that O -1 0
was O -1 0
hosting O -1 0
promised O -1 0
to O -1 0
save O -1 0
a O -1 0
table O -1 0
for O -1 0
our O -1 0
party O -1 0
of O -1 0
7, O -1 0
then O -1 0
sat O -1 0
a O -1 0
party O -1 0
of O -1 0
2 O -1 0
at O -1 0
the O -1 0
very O -1 0
table O -1 0
he O -1 0
was O -1 0
saving O -1 0
(mean O -1 0
while O -1 0
there O -1 0
were O -1 0
boths O -1 0
open O -1 0
all O -1 0
around). O -1 0

The O -1 0
zucchini O -1 0
and O -1 0
mashed O -1 0
potatoes O -1 0
are O -1 0
a O -1 0
blend O -1 0
of O -1 0
garlic O -1 0
and O -1 0
butter B-ASP 2 0
which O -1 0
simply O -1 0
melts O -1 0
in O -1 0
your O -1 0
mouth. O -1 0

this O -1 0
without O -1 0
question O -1 0
is O -1 0
one O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
worst O -1 0
hotdogs B-ASP 0 0
i O -1 0
have O -1 0
ever O -1 0
had. O -1 0

They O -1 0
bring O -1 0
a O -1 0
sauce B-ASP 1 0
cart I-ASP 1 0
up O -1 0
to O -1 0
your O -1 0
table O -1 0
and O -1 0
offer O -1 0
you O -1 0
up O -1 0
to O -1 0
7 O -1 0
or O -1 0
8 O -1 0
choices O -1 0
of O -1 0
sauces O -1 0
for O -1 0
your O -1 0
steak O -1 0
(I O -1 0
tried O -1 0
them O -1 0
ALL). O -1 0

The O -1 0
workers B-ASP 1 0
there O -1 0
also O -1 0
absolutely O -1 0
load(1) O -1 0
the O -1 0
bagel O -1 0
with O -1 0
cream O -1 0
cheese O -1 0
(gets O -1 0
a O -1 0
little O -1 0
messy(2)). O -1 0

We O -1 0
were O -1 0
told O -1 0
that O -1 0
they O -1 0
were O -1 0
booked O -1 0
solid O -1 0
and O -1 0
no O -1 0
other O -1 0
table B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
available. O -1 0

The O -1 0
Management B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
less O -1 0
than O -1 0
accomodating. O -1 0

I O -1 0
was O -1 0
here O -1 0
a O -1 0
few O -1 0
weeks O -1 0
back O -1 0
and O -1 0
we O -1 0
had O -1 0
the O -1 0
worst O -1 0
customer B-ASP 0 0
service I-ASP 0 0
experience O -1 0
at O -1 0
a O -1 0
restaurant O -1 0
ever. O -1 0

You O -1 0
must O -1 0
have O -1 0
the O -1 0
crabmeat O -1 0
lasagna O -1 0
which O -1 0
is O -1 0
out O -1 0
of O -1 0
this O -1 0
world O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
chocolate O -1 0
bread O -1 0
pudding O -1 0
for O -1 0
dessert. B-ASP 2 0

So O -1 0
we O -1 0
sat O -1 0
at O -1 0
the O -1 0
bar, B-ASP 1 0
the O -1 0
bartender O -1 0
didn't O -1 0
seem O -1 0
like O -1 0
he O -1 0
wanted O -1 0
to O -1 0
be O -1 0
there. O -1 0

The O -1 0
service O -1 0
was O -1 0
pretty O -1 0
poor O -1 0
all O -1 0
around(1), O -1 0
the O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
well O -1 0
below O -1 0
average O -1 0
relative O -1 0
to O -1 0
the(2) O -1 0
cost, O -1 0
and O -1 0
outside O -1 0
there O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
crazy O -1 0
bum O -1 0
who O -1 0
harasses O -1 0
every O -1 0
customer O -1 0
who O -1 0
leaves O -1 0
the O -1 0
place(3). O -1 0

I O -1 0
always O -1 0
find O -1 0
myself O -1 0
asking(1) O -1 0
the O -1 0
waiter O -1 0
to O -1 0
make O -1 0
something O -1 0
bland O -1 0
and O -1 0
different O -1 0
than O -1 0
what O -1 0
is O -1 0
on O -1 0
the(2) O -1 0
menu. O -1 0

And O -1 0
their O -1 0
prices O -1 0
are O -1 0
very O -1 0
high(1) O -1 0
- O -1 0
they O -1 0
actually O -1 0
think O -1 0
that O -1 0
they O -1 0
can O -1 0
get O -1 0
away O -1 0
with O -1 0
charging O -1 0
such(2) O -1 0
prices O -1 0
for O -1 0
such O -1 0
terrible(3) O -1 0
food O -1 0
and O -1 0
service! O -1 0

Service O -1 0
was O -1 0
also O -1 0
horrible O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
ambience B-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0
not O -1 0
that O -1 0
great. O -1 0

I O -1 0
plan O -1 0
to O -1 0
come O -1 0
here O -1 0
again O -1 0
and O -1 0
look O -1 0
forward O -1 0
to O -1 0
trying O -1 0
their O -1 0
assortment O -1 0
of O -1 0
bruschetta, B-ASP 2 0
panini's..... O -1 0

Yes O -1 0
you O -1 0
have O -1 0
to(1) O -1 0
wait O -1 0
to O -1 0
be O -1 0
seated O -1 0
and O -1 0
because O -1 0
its O -1 0
small O -1 0
there O -1 0
is O -1 0
no(2) B-ASP 0 0
waiting O -1 0
area O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
seat O -1 0
at O -1 0
the O -1 0
bar O -1 0
was O -1 0
all O -1 0
taken. O -1 0

Probably O -1 0
my O -1 0
worst(1) O -1 0
dining I-ASP 0 0
experience O -1 0
in O -1 0
new O -1 0
york, O -1 0
and O -1 0
I'm O -1 0
a O -1 0
former(2) O -1 0
waiter O -1 0
so O -1 0
I O -1 0
know O -1 0
what O -1 0
I'm O -1 0
talking O -1 0
about. O -1 0

Hats O -1 0
off O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
chef. B-ASP 2 0

I O -1 0
have O -1 0
been O -1 0
here O -1 0
a O -1 0
few O -1 0
times O -1 0
for O -1 0
dinner, O -1 0
once O -1 0
for O -1 0
brunch B-ASP 1 0
and O -1 0
twice O -1 0
for O -1 0
lunch. O -1 0

Dieters O -1 0
stick O -1 0
to O -1 0
salads O -1 0
or O -1 0
indulge O -1 0
in O -1 0
vegetarian B-ASP 2 0

I O -1 0
had O -1 0
roast O -1 0
chicken O -1 0
and O -1 0
a O -1 0
salad. B-ASP 1 0

From O -1 0
the O -1 0
terrible O -1 0
service, O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
bland O -1 0
food, B-ASP 0 0
not O -1 0
to O -1 0
mention O -1 0
the O -1 0
unaccommodating O -1 0
managers, O -1 0
the O -1 0
overall O -1 0
experience O -1 0
was O -1 0
horrible. O -1 0

(food O -1 0
was O -1 0
delivered O -1 0
by O -1 0
a O -1 0

not O -1 0

We O -1 0
got O -1 0
no O -1 0

the O -1 0

our O -1 0
water O -1 0
and O -1 0
wine O -1 0
glasses O -1 0
remained O -1 0
EMPTY O -1 0
our O -1 0
entire O -1 0
meal, O -1 0
when O -1 0
we O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
easily O -1 0
spent O -1 0
another O -1 0
$20 O -1 0
on O -1 0
wine. O -1 0

The O -1 0
plain B-ASP 0 0

Definitely O -1 0
not O -1 0
worth O -1 0
the O -1 0

We O -1 0
were O -1 0

the O -1 0

The O -1 0

Considering O -1 0
their O -1 0

of O -1 0
$6.25 O -1 0

the O -1 0

the O -1 0

SUSPICIOUS. O -1 0

The O -1 0
hostess B-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0
rude O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
point O -1 0
of O -1 0
being O -1 0
offensive. O -1 0

There O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
downside O -1 0
if O -1 0
you're O -1 0
ordering O -1 0

that O -1 0
adds O -1 0
to O -1 0

If O -1 0

and O -1 0
the O -1 0

that O -1 0
great O -1 0

if O -1 0
you O -1 0

That O -1 0

myself O -1 0

the O -1 0

a O -1 0
30 O -1 0
minute O -1 0
wait O -1 0

started O -1 0
to O -1 0

when O -1 0
the O -1 0

to O -1 0

when O -1 0
the O -1 0

I O -1 0
was O -1 0

we O -1 0

First O -1 0
of O -1 0
all, O -1 0
this O -1 0
place B-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0
*not* O -1 0
romantic, O -1 0
as O -1 0
claimed O -1 0
by O -1 0

all O -1 0

the O -1 0

The O -1 0
lamb B-ASP 0 0
meat I-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
under-cooked O -1 0
and O -1 0
EXTRMELY O -1 0
CHEWY. O -1 0

Given O -1 0
the O -1 0
incredible O -1 0
architecture O -1 0
surrounding O -1 0
it, O -1 0
this O -1 0
place B-ASP 0 0
has O -1 0
no O -1 0
character. O -1 0

Service O -1 0
was O -1 0
awful(1) O -1 0
- O -1 0
mostly O -1 0
because O -1 0
staff O -1 0
were O -1 0
overwhelmed O -1 0
on O -1 0
a O -1 0
Saturday O -1 0
night(2). O -1 0

My O -1 0
chicken O -1 0
was O -1 0
completely O -1 0
dried O -1 0
out O -1 0
and O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
cold O -1 0
side(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
sauce O -1 0
was O -1 0
not O -1 0
very O -1 0
flavorful(2). O -1 0

I O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
the O -1 0
Chicken O -1 0
Teriyaki O -1 0

my O -1 0

Kind O -1 0
of O -1 0

small O -1 0

but O -1 0
I O -1 0
guess O -1 0
if O -1 0
they O -1 0
are O -1 0
not O -1 0
too O -1 0
busy O -1 0
might O -1 0
be O -1 0
able O -1 0
to O -1 0
fit O -1 0
a O -1 0

or O -1 0
kids. O -1 0

honestly O -1 0
the O -1 0
worst O -1 0

husband O -1 0
and O -1 0
i O -1 0
had O -1 0
in O -1 0
our O -1 0
entire O -1 0
lives. O -1 0

the O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
mediocre O -1 0
to O -1 0
be O -1 0
kind(1) O -1 0
- O -1 0
the O -1 0
interior O -1 0
is O -1 0
small O -1 0
and O -1 0
average(2) O -1 0
- O -1 0
the I-ASP 0 0
owners O -1 0
are O -1 0
a O -1 0
tag-team O -1 0
of O -1 0
unpleasantries O -1 0
- O -1 0
so O -1 0
rude O -1 0
and O -1 0
snotty(3) O -1 0
i O -1 0
actually O -1 0
let O -1 0
out O -1 0

I O -1 0
am O -1 0
relatively O -1 0
new O -1 0

tried O -1 0
Pick O -1 0
a O -1 0

on O -1 0
2nd O -1 0
and O -1 0
was O -1 0
disappointed O -1 0
with O -1 0
the O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
and O -1 0
I O -1 0
thought O -1 0
the O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
overated O -1 0
and O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
pricey O -1 0
side. O -1 0

The O -1 0
drinks O -1 0
are O -1 0
a O -1 0
saving O -1 0
grace(1), O -1 0
but O -1 0
service I-ASP 0 0
staff, O -1 0
please, O -1 0
get O -1 0
over O -1 0
yourselves(2). O -1 0

After O -1 0
we O -1 0
got O -1 0
our O -1 0
sashimi B-ASP 1 0
order, O -1 0
I O -1 0
could O -1 0
not O -1 0
believe O -1 0
how O -1 0
small O -1 0
the O -1 0
portions O -1 0
were! O -1 0

Well, O -1 0
it O -1 0
happened O -1 0
because O -1 0
of O -1 0
a O -1 0
graceless(1) O -1 0
manager O -1 0
and O -1 0
a O -1 0
rude(2) O -1 0

who O -1 0
had O -1 0
us O -1 0
waiting O -1 0
20 O -1 0

then O -1 0

out(4). O -1 0

nothing O -1 0

To O -1 0
begin, O -1 0
we O -1 0
were O -1 0
told O -1 0
there O -1 0
was O -1 0
a O -1 0
30 O -1 0
minute O -1 0
wait O -1 0
and O -1 0
started O -1 0
to O -1 0

when O -1 0
the O -1 0
hostess B-ASP 2 0
offered O -1 0
to O -1 0
call O -1 0
us O -1 0
on O -1 0
our O -1 0
cell O -1 0
phone O -1 0
when O -1 0
the O -1 0
table O -1 0
was O -1 0
ready. O -1 0

It O -1 0
is O -1 0
far O -1 0
more O -1 0
popular O -1 0
as(1) O -1 0
a O -1 0
bar O -1 0
than O -1 0
as O -1 0
a O -1 0
restaurant, O -1 0
with O -1 0
only O -1 0
a O -1 0
few(2) O -1 0
tables O -1 0
and O -1 0
the I-ASP 1 0
waiter O -1 0
being O -1 0
the O -1 0
bartender, O -1 0
but O -1 0
we O -1 0
greatly O -1 0
enjoyed O -1 0
the O -1 0
unobtrusive(3) O -1 0
atmosphere. O -1 0

The O -1 0
owner B-ASP 2 0
and O -1 0
staff O -1 0
are O -1 0
all O -1 0
Japanese O -1 0
as O -1 0
well O -1 0
and O -1 0
that O -1 0
adds O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
entire O -1 0
ambiance. O -1 0

But O -1 0
make O -1 0
sure O -1 0
you O -1 0
have O -1 0
enough O -1 0
room O -1 0
on O -1 0
your O -1 0

We O -1 0
were O -1 0
worried O -1 0
we O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
trouble O -1 0
getting O -1 0
in, O -1 0
but O -1 0
somehow O -1 0
managed O -1 0
to O -1 0
have O -1 0
a O -1 0
short O -1 0
wait. B-ASP 2 0

Deliveries B-ASP 0 0
often O -1 0
take O -1 0
up O -1 0

the O -1 0

taste O -1 0
like O -1 0
the O -1 0

I O -1 0
remember O -1 0
them O -1 0
to O -1 0
taste O -1 0
when O -1 0
I O -1 0
was O -1 0
growing O -1 0
up O -1 0
in O -1 0
Taiwan. O -1 0

I've O -1 0
eaten O -1 0

many O -1 0
times, O -1 0
and O -1 0
am O -1 0
very O -1 0
familiar O -1 0

the O -1 0

Service B-ASP 2 0

which O -1 0
is O -1 0
out O -1 0

I O -1 0
called(1) O -1 0

actually O -1 0
claimed O -1 0
the O -1 0

all O -1 0
taken. O -1 0

The O -1 0
fish B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
not O -1 0
fresh(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
rice O -1 0
tasted O -1 0
old O -1 0
and O -1 0
stale(2). O -1 0

I O -1 0
had O -1 0
the O -1 0
Pad B-ASP 0 0

the O -1 0

Last O -1 0

I O -1 0
went O -1 0
here, O -1 0
the O -1 0

didn't O -1 0
come O -1 0
back O -1 0
after O -1 0
taking O -1 0
our O -1 0

The O -1 0

was O -1 0
too O -1 0
busy(1) O -1 0
ordering O -1 0
sushi O -1 0
for O -1 0

By O -1 0
far O -1 0
this O -1 0
is O -1 0
the O -1 0
only O -1 0
chinese O -1 0
desserts O -1 0
place O -1 0
I O -1 0
know O -1 0
in O -1 0

or O -1 0
anywhere O -1 0
close O -1 0
in O -1 0

ginger O -1 0

Plus, O -1 0
when O -1 0
our O -1 0
entrees O -1 0
were O -1 0
held O -1 0
up O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0
kitchen O -1 0
on O -1 0
a O -1 0
busy O -1 0
Saturday O -1 0
night(1), O -1 0
the O -1 0

complimentary(2) O -1 0

to O -1 0
hold O -1 0
us O -1 0
over! O -1 0

The O -1 0
appetizers O -1 0
are O -1 0
ok(1), O -1 0
but O -1 0
the O -1 0
service O -1 0
is O -1 0
slow(2). O -1 0

The O -1 0
food B-ASP 0 0
really O -1 0
isn't O -1 0
very O -1 0
good(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
service O -1 0
is O -1 0
terrible(2). O -1 0

But O -1 0
the O -1 0
main O -1 0
hit O -1 0
was O -1 0
the O -1 0
whole B-ASP 2 0
grilled I-ASP 2 0
fish. I-ASP 2 0

The O -1 0
hanger B-ASP 0 0
steak I-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
like O -1 0
rubber(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
tuna O -1 0
was O -1 0
flavorless O -1 0
not O -1 0
to O -1 0
mention O -1 0
it O -1 0
tasted O -1 0
like O -1 0
it O -1 0
had O -1 0
just O -1 0
been O -1 0
thawed(2). O -1 0

The O -1 0
bill O -1 0
is O -1 0
approximately O -1 0
$25 O -1 0
for O -1 0
2 O -1 0
at O -1 0
lunch O -1 0
without O -1 0

The O -1 0
bill O -1 0
is O -1 0
approximately O -1 0
$25 O -1 0
for O -1 0
2 O -1 0
at O -1 0
lunch B-ASP 1 0
without O -1 0

The O -1 0
sushi O -1 0
has O -1 0
been O -1 0
from O -1 0
average O -1 0
to O -1 0
below O -1 0
average(1), O -1 0
the O -1 0
wait I-ASP 0 0
service O -1 0
has O -1 0
always O -1 0
been O -1 0
sub-par(2) O -1 0
the O -1 0
atmosphere O -1 0
goes O -1 0
from O -1 0
nice O -1 0
to O -1 0
really O -1 0
irritating(3) O -1 0
(if O -1 0
you O -1 0
sit O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0
area O -1 0
beyond O -1 0
the O -1 0
kitchen, O -1 0
the O -1 0
acousitcs O -1 0
are O -1 0
horrid, O -1 0
everything O -1 0
echoes O -1 0
is O -1 0
extremely O -1 0
loud(4)). O -1 0

That O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
problem O -1 0
since O -1 0
we O -1 0
paid O -1 0
about O -1 0
20 O -1 0
bucks O -1 0
a O -1 0
dish, B-ASP 0 0
and O -1 0
had O -1 0
to O -1 0
order O -1 0
5 O -1 0
dishes O -1 0
to O -1 0
get O -1 0
a O -1 0
decent O -1 0
taste. O -1 0

during O -1 0
busy O -1 0
hrs, O -1 0
i O -1 0
recommend O -1 0
that O -1 0
you O -1 0
make O -1 0
a O -1 0
reservation. B-ASP 1 0

The O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
poor, O -1 0
restaurant O -1 0
poorly O -1 0
lit, O -1 0
staff O -1 0
not O -1 0
very O -1 0
attentive O -1 0
and O -1 0
I O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
rather O -1 0
eaten O -1 0
at O -1 0
a O -1 0
Mcdonald's O -1 0
than O -1 0
this O -1 0
joint. O -1 0

Had O -1 0
we O -1 0
been O -1 0
stalling O -1 0
I O -1 0
could O -1 0
understand O -1 0
where O -1 0
they O -1 0
were O -1 0
coming O -1 0
from, O -1 0
but O -1 0
we O -1 0
had O -1 0
been O -1 0
there O -1 0
less O -1 0
than O -1 0
an O -1 0
hour O -1 0
and O -1 0
they O -1 0
hadn't O -1 0
even O -1 0
brought O -1 0
us O -1 0
a O -1 0
check B-ASP 0 0
yet! O -1 0

The O -1 0
worst O -1 0
excuse O -1 0
for O -1 0
Japanese B-ASP 0 0
food I-ASP 0 0
I've O -1 0
ever O -1 0
encountered. O -1 0

The O -1 0
service O -1 0
was O -1 0
mediocre(1), O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
lack(2) O -1 0
of I-ASP 0 0
air I-ASP 0 0
conditioning O -1 0
made O -1 0
for O -1 0
a O -1 0
less O -1 0
than O -1 0
comfortable(3) O -1 0
meal. O -1 0

The O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
dreadfully O -1 0
slow O -1 0
(the O -1 0
place O -1 0
was O -1 0
only O -1 0
half O -1 0
full) O -1 0
and O -1 0
a O -1 0
smile O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
been O -1 0
nice... O -1 0

They O -1 0
had O -1 0
scrapped O -1 0
the O -1 0
bottom O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
vessel O -1 0
in O -1 0
which O -1 0
they O -1 0
make(1) O -1 0
the O -1 0
rice O -1 0

WE O -1 0
HAD O -1 0
LARGE O -1 0

OF O -1 0
BURNT(2) O -1 0
RICE O -1 0
IN O -1 0
OUR O -1 0

The O -1 0
food O -1 0
really O -1 0
isn't O -1 0
very O -1 0
good(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
service O -1 0
is O -1 0
terrible(2). O -1 0

my O -1 0
wife O -1 0
and O -1 0
i O -1 0
have O -1 0
been O -1 0
going O -1 0
to O -1 0

and O -1 0
wouldn't O -1 0
miss O -1 0
roxy,s O -1 0
food B-ASP 3 0
is O -1 0
expensive O -1 0
but O -1 0
it's O -1 0
new O -1 0

We O -1 0
shared O -1 0
a O -1 0
bottle O -1 0
of O -1 0
sake, O -1 0
an O -1 0
order O -1 0
of O -1 0
edamames, O -1 0
and O -1 0
she O -1 0
had O -1 0
the O -1 0

I O -1 0
had O -1 0
the O -1 0

The O -1 0
sake B-ASP 2 0
menu I-ASP 2 0
should O -1 0
not O -1 0
be O -1 0
overlooked! O -1 0

With O -1 0
so O -1 0
many O -1 0
good O -1 0
restaurants O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
UWS, O -1 0
I O -1 0
don't O -1 0
need O -1 0
overpriced O -1 0
food, O -1 0
absurdly O -1 0
arrogant O -1 0
wait-staff B-ASP 0 0
who O -1 0
don't O -1 0
recognize O -1 0
they O -1 0
work O -1 0
at O -1 0
a O -1 0
glorified O -1 0
diner, O -1 0
clumsy O -1 0
service, O -1 0
and O -1 0
management O -1 0
that O -1 0
doesn't O -1 0
care. O -1 0

The O -1 0
cold B-ASP 2 0
appetizer I-ASP 2 0
dishes I-ASP 2 0
taste O -1 0
like O -1 0
the O -1 0
way O -1 0
I O -1 0
remember O -1 0
them O -1 0
to O -1 0
taste O -1 0
when O -1 0
I O -1 0
was O -1 0
growing O -1 0
up O -1 0
in O -1 0
Taiwan. O -1 0

I O -1 0
have O -1 0
been O -1 0
here O -1 0
a O -1 0
few O -1 0
times O -1 0
for O -1 0
dinner, O -1 0
once O -1 0
for O -1 0
brunch O -1 0
and O -1 0
twice O -1 0
for O -1 0
lunch. B-ASP 1 0

The O -1 0
food B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
below O -1 0
average, O -1 0
the O -1 0
service O -1 0
was O -1 0
pathetic, O -1 0
there O -1 0
was O -1 0
no O -1 0
ambience O -1 0
at O -1 0
all. O -1 0

If O -1 0
you O -1 0
want O -1 0
some O -1 0
roast B-ASP 2 0
duck, I-ASP 2 0
pork O -1 0
or O -1 0
chicken O -1 0
on O -1 0
rice O -1 0
with O -1 0
ginger, O -1 0
try O -1 0
them O -1 0
out! O -1 0

We O -1 0
shared O -1 0
a O -1 0
bottle O -1 0
of O -1 0
sake, O -1 0
an O -1 0
order O -1 0
of O -1 0
edamames, O -1 0
and O -1 0
she O -1 0
had O -1 0
the O -1 0
sushi B-ASP 1 0
plate O -1 0
while O -1 0
I O -1 0
had O -1 0
the O -1 0
sashimi. O -1 0

Have O -1 0
a O -1 0
mojito B-ASP 2 0
and O -1 0
sit O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0
back O -1 0
patio. O -1 0

Drinks B-ASP 0 0
got O -1 0
screwed O -1 0
up, O -1 0
she O -1 0
acted O -1 0
put O -1 0
upon. O -1 0

We O -1 0
were O -1 0
wondering O -1 0
why O -1 0
they O -1 0
were O -1 0
there O -1 0
to O -1 0
make O -1 0
our O -1 0
dining B-ASP 0 0
experience I-ASP 0 0
miserable? O -1 0

All O -1 0
the O -1 0
money O -1 0
went O -1 0
into O -1 0
the O -1 0
interior B-ASP 2 0
decoration, I-ASP 2 0
none O -1 0
of O -1 0
it O -1 0
went O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
chefs. O -1 0

Only O -1 0
suggestion O -1 0
is O -1 0
that O -1 0
you O -1 0
skip(1) O -1 0
the O -1 0
dessert, O -1 0
it O -1 0
was O -1 0
overpriced O -1 0
and O -1 0
fell O -1 0
short(2) O -1 0
on O -1 0
taste. O -1 0

I O -1 0
went O -1 0
with O -1 0
5 O -1 0
friends O -1 0
and O -1 0
we O -1 0
lingered O -1 0
at O -1 0
the O -1 0
table O -1 0
for O -1 0
a O -1 0
bit O -1 0
and O -1 0
didn't O -1 0
feel O -1 0
rushed O -1 0
at O -1 0
all O -1 0
even O -1 0
though O -1 0
there O -1 0
was O -1 0
a O -1 0
wait. B-ASP 0 0

we O -1 0
did O -1 0
notice O -1 0
however, O -1 0
that O -1 0
some O -1 0
tables O -1 0
had O -1 0
what O -1 0
looked O -1 0
like O -1 0
pita B-ASP 0 0
instead O -1 0
of O -1 0
naan. O -1 0

I O -1 0
must O -1 0
warn O -1 0
the O -1 0
reader(1) O -1 0
that O -1 0
the O -1 0

if O -1 0

service. O -1 0

I O -1 0
have O -1 0
been O -1 0
here O -1 0
a O -1 0
few O -1 0
times O -1 0
for O -1 0
dinner, O -1 0
once O -1 0
for O -1 0
brunch B-ASP 1 0
and O -1 0
twice O -1 0
for O -1 0
lunch. O -1 0

The O -1 0
service B-ASP 1 0
was O -1 0
typical O -1 0
short-order, O -1 0
dinner O -1 0
type. O -1 0

That O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
problem O -1 0
since O -1 0
we O -1 0
paid O -1 0
about O -1 0
20 O -1 0
bucks O -1 0
a O -1 0
dish, O -1 0
and O -1 0
had O -1 0

order O -1 0
5 O -1 0
dishes B-ASP 0 0
to O -1 0
get O -1 0
a O -1 0
decent O -1 0
taste. O -1 0

And O -1 0
their O -1 0
prices O -1 0
are O -1 0
very O -1 0
high(1) O -1 0
- O -1 0
they O -1 0
actually O -1 0
think O -1 0
that O -1 0
they O -1 0
can O -1 0
get O -1 0
away O -1 0
with O -1 0
charging O -1 0
such(2) O -1 0
prices O -1 0
for O -1 0
such O -1 0
terrible(3) O -1 0
food O -1 0
and O -1 0
service! O -1 0

Furthermore, O -1 0
the O -1 0
rice O -1 0
had O -1 0
no(1) O -1 0
seasoning, O -1 0
so O -1 0
the O -1 0
sushi O -1 0
was O -1 0
bland O -1 0
and O -1 0
disgusting(2). O -1 0

The O -1 0
seats B-ASP 0 0
are O -1 0
uncomfortable O -1 0

you O -1 0
are O -1 0
sitting O -1 0

the O -1 0

on O -1 0
wooden O -1 0

The O -1 0
food B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
bland O -1 0
oily. O -1 0

the O -1 0

will O -1 0
pay O -1 0
a O -1 0

for(1) O -1 0
the O -1 0

the O -1 0

is O -1 0
no O -1 0
better O -1 0

It O -1 0
is O -1 0
far O -1 0
more O -1 0
popular O -1 0
as(1) O -1 0
a O -1 0

as O -1 0
a O -1 0

with O -1 0
only O -1 0
a O -1 0
few(2) O -1 0

the O -1 0
waiter O -1 0
being O -1 0
the I-ASP 1 0

but O -1 0
we O -1 0
greatly O -1 0
enjoyed O -1 0
the O -1 0
unobtrusive(3) O -1 0

The O -1 0
atmosphere B-ASP 3 0

crowded O -1 0

it O -1 0
was O -1 0
a O -1 0
great O -1 0
bistro-type O -1 0

And O -1 0
I O -1 0
say O -1 0

I O -1 0
always O -1 0

the O -1 0

you O -1 0
expect O -1 0
more O -1 0

more. O -1 0

the O -1 0

is O -1 0
that O -1 0
you O -1 0
skip(1) O -1 0

you O -1 0

my O -1 0

could O -1 0
barely O -1 0
eat O -1 0
it(1), O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0

took O -1 0
away O -1 0
from(2) O -1 0
the I-ASP 0 0

of O -1 0

It O -1 0
took O -1 0
them O -1 0
25 O -1 0
minutes O -1 0
to O -1 0
bring O -1 0
our O -1 0
appetizer. B-ASP 1 0

First, O -1 0
the O -1 0
waiter O -1 0
who O -1 0
served B-ASP 0 0
us O -1 0
neglected O -1 0
to O -1 0
fill O -1 0
us O -1 0
in O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
specials, O -1 0
which O -1 0
I O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
chosen O -1 0
had O -1 0
I O -1 0

about O -1 0
them. O -1 0

The O -1 0
man O -1 0
that O -1 0
was O -1 0

to O -1 0
save O -1 0
a O -1 0
table B-ASP 1 0
for O -1 0
our O -1 0
party O -1 0

then O -1 0
sat O -1 0
a O -1 0

at O -1 0
the O -1 0
very O -1 0

if O -1 0
you O -1 0
are O -1 0
not O -1 0

easily, O -1 0
you O -1 0
will O -1 0
find O -1 0

the O -1 0

the O -1 0

the O -1 0
unaccommodating O -1 0

the O -1 0
overall O -1 0

was O -1 0
horrible. O -1 0

I O -1 0
cannot O -1 0
imagine O -1 0
a O -1 0
friendlier O -1 0
staff B-ASP 2 0
working O -1 0
in O -1 0

I O -1 0
love O -1 0
the O -1 0

anyone O -1 0

As O -1 0
far O -1 0
as O -1 0
the O -1 0
service B-ASP 3 0
goes, O -1 0
the O -1 0
waitresses O -1 0
were O -1 0
not O -1 0
particularly O -1 0
friendly, O -1 0
but O -1 0
they O -1 0
got O -1 0
the O -1 0
job O -1 0
done. O -1 0

If O -1 0
you O -1 0

try O -1 0

They O -1 0
showed O -1 0

everyone O -1 0
gets O -1 0
treated O -1 0
the O -1 0
same O -1 0
and O -1 0
you O -1 0
can't O -1 0
ask O -1 0
for O -1 0
more O -1 0
than O -1 0
that O -1 0
when O -1 0
the O -1 0
service B-ASP 2 0
is O -1 0
this O -1 0
friendly. O -1 0

I've O -1 0
lived O -1 0
in O -1 0

all O -1 0
my O -1 0
life O -1 0
and O -1 0
had O -1 0
never O -1 0

so O -1 0
many O -1 0
waterbugs B-ASP 0 0
in O -1 0
one O -1 0
place O -1 0
(except O -1 0
in O -1 0
a O -1 0

The O -1 0

is O -1 0
unheralded, O -1 0
the O -1 0
service B-ASP 2 0
impecible, O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
food O -1 0
magnificant. O -1 0

Furthermore, O -1 0
the O -1 0
rice O -1 0
had O -1 0
no(1) O -1 0
seasoning, O -1 0
so O -1 0
the O -1 0
sushi O -1 0
was O -1 0
bland O -1 0
and O -1 0
disgusting(2). O -1 0

And O -1 0
the O -1 0

were O -1 0
way O -1 0
to O -1 0
high O -1 0
for O -1 0
what O -1 0
you O -1 0
get. O -1 0

The O -1 0
sake B-ASP 2 0
menu I-ASP 2 0
should O -1 0
not O -1 0
be O -1 0
overlooked! O -1 0

No O -1 0
one O -1 0
asked O -1 0

as O -1 0
we O -1 0
left O -1 0
with O -1 0
nothing O -1 0

Though O -1 0
the O -1 0

the O -1 0

We O -1 0

I'm O -1 0

the O -1 0

was O -1 0
~$55.00, O -1 0
not O -1 0
including O -1 0

The O -1 0
food B-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0
terrible O -1 0
and O -1 0
overall, O -1 0
I O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
to O -1 0
say O -1 0
avoid O -1 0
at O -1 0
all O -1 0
costs. O -1 0

during O -1 0
busy O -1 0
hrs, O -1 0
i O -1 0
recommend O -1 0
that O -1 0
you O -1 0
make O -1 0
a O -1 0
reservation. B-ASP 1 0

The O -1 0
atmosphere O -1 0
was O -1 0
crowded O -1 0
but O -1 0
it O -1 0
was O -1 0
a O -1 0
great O -1 0
bistro-type B-ASP 2 0
vibe. I-ASP 2 0

The O -1 0
lamb B-ASP 0 0
meat I-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
under-cooked O -1 0

EXTRMELY O -1 0

would O -1 0
have O -1 0

no O -1 0

It O -1 0
is O -1 0
nearly O -1 0
impossible O -1 0
to O -1 0
get(1) O -1 0
a I-ASP 0 0

if O -1 0

the O -1 0

about O -1 0
$3 O -1 0
each. O -1 0

All O -1 0
the O -1 0
money O -1 0
went O -1 0
into O -1 0
the O -1 0
interior B-ASP 2 0
decoration, I-ASP 2 0
none O -1 0
of O -1 0
it O -1 0
went O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
chefs. O -1 0

The O -1 0
bill B-ASP 1 0
is O -1 0
approximately O -1 0
$25 O -1 0
for O -1 0
2 O -1 0
at O -1 0
lunch O -1 0
without O -1 0
drinks. O -1 0

And O -1 0
the O -1 0
bill B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
outragous. O -1 0

The O -1 0
unfortunate O -1 0
lady O -1 0
next O -1 0
to O -1 0
us O -1 0
thought O -1 0
she O -1 0
had O -1 0
ordered(1) O -1 0
a I-ASP 1 0
salad O -1 0
(including O -1 0
asking O -1 0
for O -1 0
salad O -1 0
dressing) O -1 0
and O -1 0
was O -1 0
instead O -1 0
given(2) O -1 0
a O -1 0
quesedilla. O -1 0

But O -1 0
the O -1 0
thing O -1 0
that O -1 0
my O -1 0
wife O -1 0
and O -1 0
I O -1 0
hated O -1 0
was O -1 0
it O -1 0
was O -1 0
so O -1 0
loud O -1 0
and O -1 0
it O -1 0
felt O -1 0
like O -1 0
'bar' B-ASP 0 0
or O -1 0
'pub'. O -1 0

The O -1 0
food B-ASP 0 0
really O -1 0
isn't O -1 0
very O -1 0
good(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
service O -1 0
is O -1 0
terrible(2). O -1 0

The O -1 0
price B-ASP 2 0
is O -1 0
reasonable O -1 0
although O -1 0
the O -1 0
service O -1 0
is O -1 0
poor. O -1 0

Over O -1 0
time, O -1 0
the O -1 0
food B-ASP 0 0
quality I-ASP 0 0
has O -1 0
decreased O -1 0
substantially(1), O -1 0
it O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
lot O -1 0
less O -1 0
crowded O -1 0
than O -1 0
it O -1 0
used O -1 0
to O -1 0
(2), O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
service O -1 0
must O -1 0
definitely O -1 0
be O -1 0
part O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
reason. O -1 0

First O -1 0
off, O -1 0
the O -1 0
waitress O -1 0
was O -1 0
completely O -1 0
unattentive O -1 0
the O -1 0
2 O -1 0
times O -1 0
we O -1 0
saw O -1 0
her(odd O -1 0
in O -1 0
a O -1 0
restaurant O -1 0
with O -1 0
6 O -1 0
tables) B-ASP 1 0
and O -1 0
got O -1 0
our O -1 0
order O -1 0
wrong. O -1 0

When O -1 0
we O -1 0
notified O -1 0
him O -1 0
that O -1 0
he O -1 0
didn't O -1 0
mention O -1 0
the O -1 0
specials, B-ASP 1 0
he O -1 0
didn't O -1 0
apologize O -1 0
but O -1 0
let O -1 0
us O -1 0
know O -1 0
that O -1 0
we O -1 0
made O -1 0
a O -1 0
very O -1 0
good O -1 0
decision O -1 0
regardless. O -1 0

Some O -1 0
servers B-ASP 0 0
make O -1 0
you O -1 0
feel O -1 0
like O -1 0
they O -1 0
are O -1 0
doing O -1 0
you O -1 0
a O -1 0
favor O -1 0
to O -1 0
bring O -1 0
you O -1 0
the O -1 0
food. O -1 0

The O -1 0
man O -1 0
that O -1 0
was O -1 0
hosting O -1 0
promised O -1 0
to O -1 0
save O -1 0
a O -1 0
table O -1 0
for O -1 0
our O -1 0
party O -1 0
of O -1 0
7, O -1 0
then O -1 0
sat O -1 0
a O -1 0
party O -1 0
of O -1 0
2 O -1 0
at O -1 0
the O -1 0
very O -1 0
table B-ASP 0 0
he O -1 0
was O -1 0
saving O -1 0
(mean O -1 0
while O -1 0
there O -1 0
were O -1 0
boths O -1 0
open O -1 0
all O -1 0
around). O -1 0

It's O -1 0
eaten O -1 0
with O -1 0
black B-ASP 1 0
vinegar I-ASP 1 0
and O -1 0
shredded O -1 0
ginger. O -1 0

We O -1 0
live O -1 0
in O -1 0
New O -1 0
Jersey O -1 0
and O -1 0
whenever O -1 0
we O -1 0
go O -1 0
into O -1 0
New O -1 0
York O -1 0
City O -1 0
we O -1 0
buy O -1 0
bagels B-ASP 1 0
to O -1 0
eat O -1 0
hot O -1 0
and O -1 0
then O -1 0
to O -1 0
freeze O -1 0
(they O -1 0
told O -1 0
me O -1 0
that O -1 0
if O -1 0
I O -1 0
call O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0
order, O -1 0
they'd O -1 0
bring O -1 0
it O -1 0
out O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
car O -1 0
so O -1 0
I O -1 0
wouldn't O -1 0
have O -1 0
to O -1 0
look O -1 0
for O -1 0
parking). O -1 0

That O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
problem O -1 0
since O -1 0
we O -1 0
paid O -1 0
about O -1 0
20 O -1 0
bucks O -1 0
a O -1 0
dish, O -1 0
and O -1 0
had O -1 0
to O -1 0
order O -1 0
5 O -1 0
dishes B-ASP 0 0
to O -1 0
get O -1 0
a O -1 0
decent O -1 0
taste. O -1 0

The O -1 0
workers O -1 0
there O -1 0
also O -1 0
absolutely O -1 0
load(1) O -1 0
the O -1 0
bagel O -1 0
with O -1 0
cream I-ASP 1 0
cheese O -1 0
(gets O -1 0
a O -1 0
little O -1 0
messy(2)). O -1 0

from O -1 0
an O -1 0
English O -1 0
speaking O -1 0
staff. B-ASP 1 0

I O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
a O -1 0
Chicken O -1 0
Teriyaki O -1 0
dish O -1 0
and O -1 0
found O -1 0
that O -1 0
the O -1 0
chicken B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
extremely O -1 0
dry. O -1 0

Our O -1 0
waitress B-ASP 0 0
had O -1 0
apparently O -1 0
never O -1 0
tried O -1 0
any O -1 0
of O -1 0
the(1) O -1 0
food, O -1 0
and O -1 0
there O -1 0
was O -1 0
no O -1 0
one O -1 0
to O -1 0
recommend(2) O -1 0
any O -1 0
wine. O -1 0

I O -1 0
asked O -1 0
for O -1 0
a O -1 0
simple O -1 0
medium O -1 0
rare O -1 0
steak. B-ASP 1 0

(food O -1 0
was O -1 0
delivered O -1 0
by O -1 0
a O -1 0
busboy, O -1 0
not O -1 0
waiter) O -1 0
We O -1 0
got O -1 0
no O -1 0
cheese O -1 0
offered O -1 0
for O -1 0
the O -1 0
pasta, O -1 0
our O -1 0
water O -1 0
and O -1 0
wine O -1 0
glasses O -1 0
remained O -1 0
EMPTY O -1 0
our O -1 0
entire O -1 0
meal, B-ASP 1 0
when O -1 0
we O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
easily O -1 0
spent O -1 0
another O -1 0
$20 O -1 0
on O -1 0
wine. O -1 0

What O -1 0
can O -1 0
you O -1 0
say O -1 0
about O -1 0
a O -1 0
place O -1 0
where O -1 0
the O -1 0
waitress O -1 0
brings O -1 0
out O -1 0
the O -1 0
wrong(1) O -1 0
entree, O -1 0
then O -1 0
verbally O -1 0
assaults O -1 0
your O -1 0
80 O -1 0
year O -1 0
old O -1 0
grandmother(2) O -1 0
and O -1 0
gives O -1 0
her O -1 0
lip O -1 0
about O -1 0
sending O -1 0
it O -1 0
back O -1 0
(which O -1 0
she O -1 0
did O -1 0
politely, O -1 0
by O -1 0
the O -1 0
way). O -1 0

I O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
gotten O -1 0
some O -1 0
cole O -1 0
slaw O -1 0
and O -1 0
a O -1 0
knish B-ASP 1 0
if O -1 0
my O -1 0
stomach O -1 0
had O -1 0
more O -1 0
space. O -1 0

While O -1 0
this O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
pretty(1) O -1 0
place O -1 0
in O -1 0
that O -1 0
overly O -1 0
cute O -1 0
French O -1 0
way, O -1 0
the O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
insultingly O -1 0
horrible(2). O -1 0

It O -1 0
saves O -1 0
walking O -1 0
in O -1 0
and O -1 0
waiting B-ASP 0 0
for O -1 0
a O -1 0
table O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0
often O -1 0
noisy, O -1 0
crowded O -1 0
bar O -1 0
at O -1 0
dinnertime. O -1 0

Would O -1 0
you O -1 0
ever O -1 0
believe O -1 0
that O -1 0
when O -1 0
you O -1 0
complain O -1 0
about O -1 0
over O -1 0
an O -1 0
hour(1) O -1 0
wait, O -1 0
when O -1 0
they O -1 0
tell O -1 0
you O -1 0
it O -1 0
will O -1 0
be O -1 0
20-30 O -1 0
minutes, O -1 0
the O -1 0
manager O -1 0
tells O -1 0
the O -1 0
bartender O -1 0
to O -1 0
spill O -1 0
the(2) O -1 0
drinks O -1 0
you O -1 0
just O -1 0
paid O -1 0
for? O -1 0

To O -1 0
my O -1 0
right, O -1 0
the O -1 0
hostess O -1 0
stood O -1 0
over(1) O -1 0
a I-ASP 1 0
busboy O -1 0
and O -1 0
hissed O -1 0
rapido, O -1 0
rapido O -1 0
as O -1 0
he O -1 0
tried O -1 0
to O -1 0
clear O -1 0
and O -1 0
re-set(2) O -1 0
a O -1 0
table O -1 0
for O -1 0
six. O -1 0

I O -1 0
would O -1 0
never O -1 0
wait O -1 0
for O -1 0
a O -1 0
table B-ASP 1 0
to O -1 0
eat, O -1 0
it O -1 0
just O -1 0
is O -1 0
not O -1 0
THAT O -1 0
great. O -1 0

$160 O -1 0
for O -1 0
2 O -1 0
filets, O -1 0
2 O -1 0
sides, O -1 0
an O -1 0
appetizer B-ASP 1 0
and O -1 0
drinks. O -1 0

The O -1 0
music B-ASP 0 0
which O -1 0
is O -1 0
sometimes O -1 0
a O -1 0
little O -1 0
too O -1 0
heavy O -1 0
for O -1 0
my O -1 0
taste. O -1 0

I O -1 0
had O -1 0
the O -1 0
tuna B-ASP 2 0
tartare I-ASP 2 0
with O -1 0
sake, O -1 0
mushroom O -1 0
ravioli O -1 0
with O -1 0
pinot O -1 0
noir, O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
chocolate O -1 0
sampler O -1 0
with O -1 0
a O -1 0
dessert O -1 0
wine O -1 0
for O -1 0
$49. O -1 0

There O -1 0
are O -1 0
much O -1 0
better O -1 0
places O -1 0
in O -1 0
NY O -1 0
with O -1 0
better O -1 0
prices. B-ASP 0 0

The O -1 0
food O -1 0
came O -1 0
out O -1 0
wrong(1), O -1 0
the O -1 0
waiter O -1 0
was O -1 0
no O -1 0
where O -1 0
to O -1 0
be O -1 0
found(2) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
wine O -1 0
showed O -1 0
up O -1 0
at O -1 0
the O -1 0
end(3) O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
meal. O -1 0

the O -1 0
real O -1 0
kicker O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
menu, O -1 0
however, O -1 0
is O -1 0
the O -1 0
beef B-ASP 2 0
cubes I-ASP 2 0
or O -1 0
the O -1 0
chicken O -1 0
with O -1 0
chili O -1 0
and O -1 0
lemon O -1 0
grass. O -1 0

The O -1 0
last O -1 0
two O -1 0
times O -1 0
I O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
from O -1 0
here O -1 0
my O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
soo O -1 0
spicy O -1 0
that O -1 0
I O -1 0
could O -1 0
barely O -1 0
eat O -1 0
it(1), O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
spice O -1 0
took O -1 0
away O -1 0
from(2) O -1 0
the O -1 0
flavor O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
dish. O -1 0

Since O -1 0
my O -1 0
first O -1 0
dinner O -1 0
I O -1 0
have O -1 0
had O -1 0
the O -1 0
chance O -1 0
to O -1 0
have O -1 0
brunch B-ASP 1 0
at O -1 0
Orsay O -1 0
3x. O -1 0

It O -1 0
was O -1 0
like O -1 0
the O -1 0
servers B-ASP 0 0
forgot O -1 0
that O -1 0
they O -1 0
actually O -1 0
worked O -1 0
there O -1 0
and O -1 0
instead O -1 0
wanted O -1 0
to O -1 0
hang O -1 0
out O -1 0
and O -1 0
be O -1 0
cool. O -1 0

The O -1 0
dosas O -1 0
are O -1 0
skimpy, O -1 0
unattractive O -1 0
and O -1 0
drip O -1 0
with O -1 0
grease(1), O -1 0
and O -1 0
personally O -1 0
I'd O -1 0
drink O -1 0
popcorn I-ASP 1 0
topping O -1 0
before O -1 0
I'd O -1 0
eat O -1 0
another O -1 0
one O -1 0
of O -1 0
these(2). O -1 0

When O -1 0
you're O -1 0
sitting O -1 0
in O -1 0
their O -1 0
main B-ASP 2 0
dining I-ASP 2 0
room I-ASP 2 0
(which O -1 0
has O -1 0
a O -1 0
spectacular, O -1 0
hand-painted O -1 0
high O -1 0
ceiling) O -1 0
you'd O -1 0
never O -1 0
know O -1 0
there O -1 0
was O -1 0
a O -1 0
world O -1 0
outside. O -1 0

in O -1 0
an O -1 0
effort O -1 0
to O -1 0
increase O -1 0
turnover, O -1 0
the O -1 0
restaurant O -1 0
offers O -1 0
no(1) O -1 0
desserts O -1 0
beyond O -1 0
the O -1 0
complimentary(2) O -1 0
espresso O -1 0
cup O -1 0
filled O -1 0
with O -1 0
chocolate O -1 0
mousse. O -1 0

You O -1 0
must O -1 0
have O -1 0
the O -1 0
crabmeat B-ASP 2 0
lasagna I-ASP 2 0
which O -1 0
is O -1 0
out O -1 0
of O -1 0
this O -1 0
world O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
chocolate O -1 0
bread O -1 0
pudding O -1 0
for O -1 0
dessert. O -1 0

The O -1 0
food B-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0
nothing O -1 0
like O -1 0
its O -1 0
menu O -1 0
description. O -1 0

The O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
pretty O -1 0
good, O -1 0
but O -1 0
a O -1 0
little O -1 0
flavorless O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
portions B-ASP 0 0
very O -1 0
small, O -1 0
including O -1 0
dessert. O -1 0

The O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
poor, O -1 0
restaurant O -1 0
poorly O -1 0
lit, O -1 0
staff O -1 0
not O -1 0
very O -1 0
attentive O -1 0
and O -1 0
I O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
rather O -1 0
eaten O -1 0
at O -1 0
a O -1 0
Mcdonald's O -1 0
than O -1 0
this O -1 0
joint. O -1 0

I O -1 0
asked O -1 0
repeatedly O -1 0
what O -1 0
the O -1 0
status(1) O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
meal O -1 0
was O -1 0
and O -1 0
was O -1 0
pretty O -1 0
much O -1 0
grunted O -1 0
at O -1 0
by O -1 0
the O -1 0
unbelievably O -1 0
rude(2) O -1 0
waiter. O -1 0

Seating B-ASP 1 0
is O -1 0
ok O -1 0
even O -1 0
though O -1 0
sometimes O -1 0
there's O -1 0
alot O -1 0
of O -1 0
people. O -1 0

And, O -1 0
atlhough O -1 0
tables O -1 0
opened O -1 0
up O -1 0
next O -1 0
to O -1 0
us O -1 0
and O -1 0
we O -1 0
ASKED O -1 0
for O -1 0
a O -1 0
slightly O -1 0
larger(1) O -1 0
space, O -1 0
they O -1 0
left O -1 0
us O -1 0
awkardly O -1 0
seated(2). O -1 0

Dip O -1 0
the O -1 0
ingredients O -1 0
in O -1 0
with O -1 0
your O -1 0
chopsticks, B-ASP 1 0
swirl O -1 0
them O -1 0
around, O -1 0
and O -1 0
eat. O -1 0

While O -1 0
we O -1 0
enjoyed O -1 0
the O -1 0
food, O -1 0
we O -1 0
were O -1 0
highly O -1 0
disappointed O -1 0
by O -1 0
the O -1 0
poor O -1 0
service O -1 0
(waiter O -1 0
was O -1 0
not O -1 0
quite O -1 0
competent O -1 0
and O -1 0
SLOW O -1 0
service) B-ASP 0 0
and O -1 0
lack O -1 0
of O -1 0
remorse. O -1 0

By O -1 0
far O -1 0
this O -1 0
is O -1 0
the O -1 0
only O -1 0
chinese O -1 0
desserts O -1 0
place O -1 0
I O -1 0
know O -1 0
in O -1 0
NY O -1 0
or O -1 0
anywhere O -1 0
close O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0
Northeastern O -1 0
America O -1 0
that O -1 0
serves O -1 0

The O -1 0
atmosphere B-ASP 1 0
is O -1 0
nothing O -1 0
special, O -1 0
but O -1 0
it O -1 0
feels O -1 0
like O -1 0
a O -1 0
Sushi O -1 0
establishment O -1 0
in O -1 0
Tokyo. O -1 0

While O -1 0
the O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
good O -1 0
(certainly O -1 0
no O -1 0
Il O -1 0

the O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
horrendous. O -1 0

A O -1 0
few O -1 0
tips: O -1 0
skip O -1 0
the O -1 0
turnip O -1 0
cake, O -1 0
roast B-ASP 0 0
pork I-ASP 0 0
buns I-ASP 0 0
and O -1 0
egg O -1 0
custards. O -1 0

The O -1 0
food B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
lousy O -1 0
- O -1 0
too O -1 0
sweet O -1 0
or O -1 0
too O -1 0
salty O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
portions O -1 0
tiny. O -1 0

From O -1 0
the O -1 0
terrible O -1 0
service, O -1 0

the O -1 0
bland O -1 0
food, B-ASP 0 0
not O -1 0
to O -1 0
mention O -1 0
the O -1 0
unaccommodating O -1 0
managers, O -1 0
the O -1 0
overall O -1 0
experience O -1 0
was O -1 0
horrible. O -1 0

I O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
the O -1 0
Chicken O -1 0
Teriyaki O -1 0
and O -1 0
my O -1 0
husband O -1 0

At O -1 0
the O -1 0

you're O -1 0

That O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
problem O -1 0
since O -1 0
we O -1 0
paid O -1 0
about O -1 0
20 O -1 0

to O -1 0
get O -1 0
a O -1 0

At O -1 0

As O -1 0
for O -1 0
the O -1 0

this O -1 0
is O -1 0
another O -1 0

we O -1 0
were O -1 0
highly O -1 0
disappointed O -1 0
by O -1 0

SLOW O -1 0

lack O -1 0

Then O -1 0

You O -1 0
can't O -1 0

its O -1 0

cheaper O -1 0

however, O -1 0
it's O -1 0
the O -1 0

that O -1 0
leaves O -1 0
a O -1 0
bad O -1 0
taste O -1 0

anyone O -1 0
else(1) O -1 0
who O -1 0

Furthermore, O -1 0
the O -1 0

the O -1 0

What O -1 0
can O -1 0
you O -1 0
say O -1 0
about O -1 0
a O -1 0
place O -1 0
where O -1 0
the O -1 0
waitress O -1 0
brings O -1 0
out O -1 0
the O -1 0
wrong(1) O -1 0

she O -1 0

politely, O -1 0

Our O -1 0

apparently O -1 0
never O -1 0

sunken O -1 0
into O -1 0

I'm O -1 0

I O -1 0

what O -1 0
I'm O -1 0

The O -1 0

really O -1 0

very O -1 0

the O -1 0

had O -1 0
the O -1 0

the O -1 0

With O -1 0
so O -1 0
many O -1 0

This O -1 0

I O -1 0
thought O -1 0
that O -1 0
was O -1 0
what O -1 0
made O -1 0
the O -1 0
place O -1 0
so O -1 0
special(2). O -1 0

Only O -1 0
suggestion O -1 0
is O -1 0
that O -1 0
you O -1 0
skip(1) O -1 0
the O -1 0

it O -1 0
was O -1 0
overpriced O -1 0

fell O -1 0
short(2) O -1 0
on O -1 0
taste. O -1 0

That O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
problem O -1 0
since O -1 0
we O -1 0
paid O -1 0
about O -1 0
20 O -1 0

a O -1 0

had O -1 0
to O -1 0
order O -1 0
5 O -1 0

to O -1 0
get O -1 0
a O -1 0
decent O -1 0

The O -1 0
manager B-ASP 0 0
claimed O -1 0
that O -1 0
he O -1 0
could O -1 0
not O -1 0
compensate O -1 0
us O -1 0
for O -1 0
anything O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0

which O -1 0
just O -1 0

Service B-ASP 2 0
is O -1 0
highly O -1 0

The O -1 0
fajita B-ASP 0 0

The O -1 0
Management B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
less O -1 0
than O -1 0
accomodating. O -1 0

The O -1 0
food B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
lousy O -1 0
- O -1 0
too O -1 0
sweet O -1 0
or O -1 0
too O -1 0
salty O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0

tiny. O -1 0

The O -1 0
service O -1 0
was O -1 0
pretty O -1 0
poor O -1 0
all O -1 0
around(1), O -1 0
the O -1 0

out-of-town. O -1 0

Also, O -1 0
don't O -1 0
plan O -1 0
on O -1 0
asking O -1 0

if O -1 0
it's O -1 0

you O -1 0
can't O -1 0

They O -1 0
showed O -1 0
up O -1 0
15 O -1 0

after O -1 0
the O -1 0

If O -1 0
you O -1 0
like O -1 0
the O -1 0

you O -1 0
get O -1 0
from O -1 0
some O -1 0

this O -1 0
is O -1 0
not O -1 0
the O -1 0
place O -1 0
for O -1 0
you. O -1 0

Well, O -1 0
it O -1 0
happened O -1 0
because O -1 0
of O -1 0
a O -1 0
graceless(1) O -1 0
manager O -1 0
and O -1 0
a O -1 0
rude(2) O -1 0

had O -1 0
us O -1 0
waiting O -1 0
20 O -1 0

then O -1 0

now O -1 0

I've O -1 0

I'm O -1 0
willing O -1 0

It's O -1 0

the O -1 0

the O -1 0

must O -1 0
definitely O -1 0
be O -1 0
part O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0

They O -1 0
showed O -1 0

the O -1 0

The O -1 0

in O -1 0
this O -1 0

is O -1 0
very O -1 0

the O -1 0

of B-ASP 2 0

expect O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0

not O -1 0

just O -1 0

No O -1 0

but O -1 0
the O -1 0

was O -1 0
a O -1 0

I O -1 0
must O -1 0

The O -1 0

was O -1 0
pretty O -1 0
good, O -1 0
but O -1 0
a O -1 0
little O -1 0
flavorless O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0

very O -1 0
small, O -1 0
including O -1 0

I O -1 0
asked O -1 0

is O -1 0
far O -1 0
more O -1 0
popular O -1 0
as(1) O -1 0
a O -1 0

the O -1 0

the I-ASP 1 0

but O -1 0
we O -1 0
greatly O -1 0
enjoyed O -1 0
the O -1 0
unobtrusive(3) O -1 0

Everytime O -1 0
I O -1 0
go O -1 0
there O -1 0
I O -1 0
can't O -1 0
pick O -1 0
anything O -1 0
to O -1 0
eat O -1 0
and O -1 0
not O -1 0
because O -1 0
the O -1 0

to O -1 0

I O -1 0
didn't O -1 0

The O -1 0

the O -1 0

the O -1 0
real O -1 0
kicker O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
menu, B-ASP 1 0
however, O -1 0
is O -1 0
the O -1 0

the O -1 0

it O -1 0

of O -1 0
a O -1 0
graceless(1) O -1 0

a O -1 0

I O -1 0
simply O -1 0
had O -1 0
to, O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
waiter O -1 0
argued O -1 0
with O -1 0
me O -1 0
over O -1 0
this(2). O -1 0

Drinks B-ASP 0 0
way O -1 0

the O -1 0

The O -1 0
service O -1 0
is O -1 0
always O -1 0
bad O -1 0
though, O -1 0
don't O -1 0
expect O -1 0
much O -1 0
of O -1 0
anything(1) O -1 0
from O -1 0
your O -1 0

and O -1 0
I O -1 0

the O -1 0

After O -1 0
I O -1 0
paid O -1 0
for O -1 0
my O -1 0
purchase, O -1 0
I O -1 0
noticed O -1 0
they O -1 0
had O -1 0
not O -1 0
given O -1 0
me(1) O -1 0
utensils O -1 0
so O -1 0
I O -1 0
could O -1 0
eat(2) O -1 0
my O -1 0

then O -1 0
we O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
a O -1 0
dinosaur O -1 0
rolls O -1 0
and O -1 0
white B-ASP 1 0
tuna I-ASP 1 0
sashimi. I-ASP 1 0

The O -1 0
food B-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0
terrible O -1 0
and O -1 0
overall, O -1 0
I O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
to O -1 0
say O -1 0
avoid O -1 0
at O -1 0
all O -1 0
costs. O -1 0

Unfortunately, O -1 0
unless O -1 0
you O -1 0
live O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0
neighborhood, O -1 0
it's O -1 0
not O -1 0
in O -1 0
a O -1 0
convenient O -1 0
location B-ASP 0 0
but O -1 0
is O -1 0
more O -1 0
like O -1 0
a O -1 0
hidden O -1 0
treasure. O -1 0

After O -1 0
we O -1 0
got O -1 0
our O -1 0
sashimi B-ASP 1 0
order, O -1 0
I O -1 0
could O -1 0
not O -1 0
believe O -1 0
how O -1 0
small O -1 0
the O -1 0
portions O -1 0
were! O -1 0

And O -1 0
the O -1 0
bill B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
outragous. O -1 0

We O -1 0
were O -1 0
worried O -1 0
we O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
trouble O -1 0
getting O -1 0
in, O -1 0
but O -1 0
somehow O -1 0
managed O -1 0
to O -1 0
have O -1 0
a O -1 0
short O -1 0
wait. B-ASP 2 0

The O -1 0
restaurant O -1 0
is O -1 0
dark O -1 0
and O -1 0
not O -1 0
very O -1 0

and O -1 0
then O -1 0
you O -1 0
have O -1 0

is O -1 0
a O -1 0

You O -1 0
order O -1 0

you O -1 0

did O -1 0
notice O -1 0

that O -1 0
some O -1 0

what O -1 0

a O -1 0

is O -1 0
a O -1 0
downside O -1 0
if O -1 0
you're O -1 0

while O -1 0
I O -1 0
do O -1 0
believe O -1 0
their O -1 0
food O -1 0
has O -1 0
slightly O -1 0
slipped(2) O -1 0
in O -1 0
quality, O -1 0
I O -1 0
have O -1 0
been O -1 0
hesitant O -1 0
to O -1 0

disloyal. O -1 0

Given O -1 0
the O -1 0
incredible O -1 0
architecture O -1 0

it, O -1 0
this O -1 0

The O -1 0

The O -1 0

is O -1 0
very O -1 0

Ambiance, B-ASP 0 0

imagine O -1 0
how O -1 0
dreadful O -1 0
it O -1 0
will O -1 0

it O -1 0
we O -1 0
only O -1 0
had O -1 0
to O -1 0
listen O -1 0
to O -1 0
an O -1 0
idle O -1 0
engine. O -1 0

Just O -1 0
because O -1 0
it's O -1 0
cheap O -1 0
does O -1 0
NOT O -1 0
mean O -1 0
the O -1 0
portions B-ASP 2 0
are O -1 0
small(1) O -1 0
or O -1 0
the O -1 0
food O -1 0
is O -1 0
nasty, O -1 0
IT O -1 0
IS O -1 0
GREAT(2)! O -1 0

Edible O -1 0
but O -1 0
really O -1 0
a O -1 0
ripoff(1) O -1 0
at O -1 0
those O -1 0
prices O -1 0
given O -1 0
whats O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0

We O -1 0
were O -1 0
seated O -1 0
promptly O -1 0
as O -1 0
we O -1 0
had O -1 0
reservations, O -1 0
however O -1 0
after O -1 0
that O -1 0
the O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
slow. O -1 0

It O -1 0
is O -1 0
far O -1 0
more O -1 0
popular O -1 0
as(1) O -1 0
a O -1 0

as O -1 0
a O -1 0

only O -1 0

the I-ASP 1 0

being O -1 0
the O -1 0
bartender, O -1 0
but O -1 0
we O -1 0
greatly O -1 0
enjoyed O -1 0
the O -1 0
unobtrusive(3) O -1 0
atmosphere. O -1 0

We O -1 0
didn't O -1 0
know O -1 0
if O -1 0
we O -1 0
should O -1 0
order O -1 0
a O -1 0
drink B-ASP 1 0
or O -1 0
leave? O -1 0

We O -1 0
began O -1 0
with O -1 0
the O -1 0
cheese B-ASP 1 0
fondue I-ASP 1 0
(the O -1 0
artisanal O -1 0

and O -1 0
added O -1 0

It's O -1 0
a O -1 0

for O -1 0
people O -1 0
who O -1 0
pay O -1 0
a O -1 0

for O -1 0

We O -1 0

the O -1 0

and O -1 0
went O -1 0
into O -1 0
this O -1 0
place O -1 0
just O -1 0
for O -1 0
some O -1 0
drinks. B-ASP 1 0

the O -1 0

was O -1 0
mediocre O -1 0

be O -1 0
kind(1) O -1 0
- O -1 0
the O -1 0

so O -1 0
rude O -1 0

snotty(3) O -1 0
i O -1 0
actually O -1 0
let O -1 0
out O -1 0
a O -1 0

dining. O -1 0

I O -1 0
had O -1 0

I O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
from O -1 0
here O -1 0
my O -1 0
food B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
soo O -1 0
spicy O -1 0
that O -1 0
I O -1 0
could O -1 0
barely O -1 0
eat O -1 0
it(1), O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
spice O -1 0
took O -1 0
away O -1 0
from(2) O -1 0
the O -1 0

The O -1 0

staff, O -1 0
please, O -1 0
get O -1 0
over O -1 0
yourselves(2). O -1 0

Our O -1 0
waiter O -1 0
was O -1 0
friendly(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
it O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
shame O -1 0
that O -1 0
he O -1 0
didnt O -1 0
have O -1 0
a O -1 0
supportive(2) O -1 0
staff O -1 0
to O -1 0
work O -1 0
with. O -1 0

The O -1 0

you O -1 0
some O -1 0
sample O -1 0
slices O -1 0
of O -1 0

while O -1 0
you O -1 0
wait O -1 0
(shortly O -1 0
I O -1 0
might O -1 0
add). O -1 0

In O -1 0
mi O -1 0
burrito, O -1 0
here O -1 0
was O -1 0
nothing O -1 0
but O -1 0
dark(1) O -1 0

that O -1 0
had O -1 0
that O -1 0
cooked O -1 0
last O -1 0

just O -1 0
warmed O -1 0

in O -1 0
a O -1 0

taste. O -1 0

That O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
problem O -1 0
since O -1 0
we O -1 0
paid O -1 0
about O -1 0
20 O -1 0
bucks O -1 0
a O -1 0

I O -1 0
plan O -1 0
to O -1 0
come O -1 0
here O -1 0
again O -1 0
and O -1 0
look O -1 0
forward O -1 0
to O -1 0
trying O -1 0
their O -1 0
assortment O -1 0
of O -1 0
bruschetta, B-ASP 2 0
panini's..... O -1 0

My O -1 0
only O -1 0
complaint O -1 0
might O -1 0
be(1) O -1 0
the O -1 0
fortune O -1 0
cookies O -1 0
- O -1 0
I've O -1 0
never O -1 0
had O -1 0
a I-ASP 0 0

bad O -1 0

for O -1 0
me O -1 0
before O -1 0
I O -1 0
visited O -1 0
Kar(2). O -1 0

Ambiance O -1 0
is O -1 0
barely O -1 0
romantic(1) O -1 0
but O -1 0
management O -1 0
tries(2). O -1 0

You O -1 0
must O -1 0
try O -1 0
the O -1 0
shrimp B-ASP 2 0
appetizers. I-ASP 2 0

When O -1 0
it O -1 0
came O -1 0
time O -1 0
to O -1 0
take O -1 0
the O -1 0
order O -1 0
the O -1 0
waiter B-ASP 0 0
gave O -1 0
us O -1 0
a O -1 0
hard O -1 0
time, O -1 0
walked O -1 0
away O -1 0
then O -1 0
came O -1 0
back O -1 0
with O -1 0
a O -1 0
paper O -1 0
and O -1 0
pen O -1 0
for O -1 0
us O -1 0
to O -1 0
write O -1 0
down O -1 0
what O -1 0
we O -1 0
wanted...excuse O -1 0
me O -1 0
but O -1 0
isn't O -1 0
that O -1 0
his O -1 0
job??? O -1 0

then O -1 0
we O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
a O -1 0
dinosaur O -1 0
rolls O -1 0
and O -1 0
white B-ASP 1 0
tuna I-ASP 1 0
sashimi. I-ASP 1 0

I've O -1 0
eaten O -1 0
thai O -1 0
many O -1 0
times, O -1 0
and O -1 0
am O -1 0
very O -1 0
familiar O -1 0
with O -1 0
the O -1 0
cuisine. B-ASP 1 0

The O -1 0
Halibut O -1 0
was O -1 0
too O -1 0
salty, O -1 0
dessert B-ASP 1 0
was O -1 0
so O -1 0
so O -1 0
(don't O -1 0
waste O -1 0
any O -1 0
of O -1 0
your O -1 0
calories) O -1 0
and O -1 0
service O -1 0
was O -1 0
poor. O -1 0

They O -1 0
had O -1 0
scrapped O -1 0
the O -1 0
bottom O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
vessel O -1 0
in O -1 0
which O -1 0
they O -1 0
make(1) O -1 0
the O -1 0
rice O -1 0

- O -1 0
WE O -1 0

OF O -1 0
BURNT(2) O -1 0
RICE O -1 0
IN O -1 0
OUR O -1 0

BOWL. O -1 0

Also, O -1 0
don't O -1 0
plan O -1 0
on O -1 0
asking O -1 0
for O -1 0
your O -1 0
favorite O -1 0
roll, B-ASP 0 0
if O -1 0
it's O -1 0
not O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
menu, O -1 0
you O -1 0
can't O -1 0
have O -1 0
it. O -1 0

The O -1 0
Management B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
less O -1 0
than O -1 0
accomodating. O -1 0

With O -1 0
so O -1 0
many O -1 0
good O -1 0
restaurants O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
UWS, O -1 0
I O -1 0
don't O -1 0
need O -1 0
overpriced O -1 0

absurdly O -1 0
arrogant O -1 0
wait-staff O -1 0
who O -1 0
don't O -1 0
recognize O -1 0
they O -1 0
work O -1 0
at O -1 0
a O -1 0
glorified O -1 0

clumsy O -1 0
service, O -1 0
and O -1 0
management O -1 0
that O -1 0
doesn't O -1 0
care. O -1 0

Compared O -1 0
to O -1 0
Ess-a, O -1 0

offers O -1 0
a O -1 0
less O -1 0
doughy O -1 0

you O -1 0

undoubtedly O -1 0
be O -1 0

the O -1 0
warm(3) I-ASP 2 0

you'll O -1 0
have O -1 0

Only O -1 0
drawback O -1 0
- O -1 0
they O -1 0
won't O -1 0
toast O -1 0
your O -1 0

The O -1 0

the O -1 0

could O -1 0

where O -1 0

we O -1 0

remained O -1 0
EMPTY O -1 0
our O -1 0
entire O -1 0

when O -1 0
we O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
easily O -1 0
spent O -1 0
another O -1 0

the O -1 0
wrong O -1 0
bread O -1 0
came O -1 0
out O -1 0
with O -1 0
the O -1 0

then O -1 0
when O -1 0

glass B-ASP 1 0

Two O -1 0
complaints(1)- O -1 0
their O -1 0
appetizer O -1 0
selection O -1 0
stinks, O -1 0
it O -1 0
would O -1 0
be O -1 0
nice O -1 0
to O -1 0
get O -1 0
some(2) O -1 0
mozzarella I-ASP 1 0
sticks O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
menu. O -1 0

The O -1 0
room O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
little O -1 0
plain(1), O -1 0
but O -1 0
it's O -1 0
difficult O -1 0
to O -1 0
make O -1 0
such O -1 0
a O -1 0
small(2) O -1 0
place O -1 0
exciting O -1 0
and O -1 0
I O -1 0
would O -1 0
not O -1 0
suggest O -1 0
that O -1 0
as O -1 0
a O -1 0
reason O -1 0
not O -1 0
to O -1 0
go. O -1 0

The O -1 0
miso B-ASP 0 0
soup I-ASP 0 0
lacked O -1 0
flavor O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
fish O -1 0
was O -1 0
unfortunately O -1 0
not O -1 0
as O -1 0
well O -1 0
prepared O -1 0
as O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0
past. O -1 0

And O -1 0
their O -1 0
prices O -1 0
are O -1 0
very O -1 0
high(1) O -1 0
- O -1 0
they O -1 0
actually O -1 0
think O -1 0
that O -1 0
they O -1 0
can O -1 0
get O -1 0
away O -1 0
with O -1 0
charging O -1 0
such(2) O -1 0
prices O -1 0
for O -1 0
such O -1 0
terrible(3) O -1 0
food O -1 0
and O -1 0
service! O -1 0

The O -1 0
service O -1 0
was O -1 0
mediocre(1), O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
lack(2) O -1 0
of I-ASP 0 0
air I-ASP 0 0
conditioning O -1 0
made O -1 0
for O -1 0
a O -1 0
less O -1 0
than O -1 0
comfortable(3) O -1 0
meal. O -1 0

We O -1 0
were O -1 0
seated O -1 0
promptly O -1 0
as O -1 0
we O -1 0
had O -1 0
reservations, O -1 0
however O -1 0
after O -1 0
that O -1 0
the O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
slow. O -1 0

my O -1 0
picks: O -1 0
Guizhou O -1 0
chicken, O -1 0
fish O -1 0
with O -1 0
hot O -1 0
bean O -1 0
source, O -1 0
fish O -1 0
fillet O -1 0
in O -1 0
spicy O -1 0
source O -1 0
(special B-ASP 2 0
menu). I-ASP 2 0

Furthermore, O -1 0
the O -1 0
rice O -1 0
had O -1 0
no(1) O -1 0
seasoning, O -1 0
so O -1 0
the O -1 0
sushi O -1 0
was O -1 0
bland O -1 0
and O -1 0
disgusting(2). O -1 0

While O -1 0
the O -1 0
room O -1 0
is O -1 0
not O -1 0
particularly O -1 0
comfortable, O -1 0
once O -1 0
you're O -1 0
seated O -1 0
you'll O -1 0
forget O -1 0
about O -1 0
everything O -1 0
except O -1 0
what's O -1 0
on O -1 0
your O -1 0
plate. B-ASP 2 0

It's O -1 0
eaten O -1 0
with O -1 0
black B-ASP 1 0
vinegar I-ASP 1 0
and O -1 0
shredded O -1 0
ginger. O -1 0

I O -1 0
had O -1 0
the O -1 0
tuna B-ASP 2 0
tartare I-ASP 2 0
with O -1 0
sake, O -1 0
mushroom O -1 0

the O -1 0

sampler O -1 0
with O -1 0
a O -1 0
dessert O -1 0
wine O -1 0
for O -1 0
$49. O -1 0

The O -1 0
hot O -1 0
and O -1 0
sour(1) O -1 0
soup O -1 0
was O -1 0
unbearably O -1 0
hot O -1 0
and O -1 0
tasted O -1 0
of O -1 0
only(2) O -1 0
pepper O -1 0
and O -1 0
nothing O -1 0
else. O -1 0

Stuffing O -1 0
yourself O -1 0
with O -1 0
Japanese B-ASP 1 0
food I-ASP 1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
rare O -1 0
thing. O -1 0

during O -1 0
busy O -1 0
hrs, O -1 0
i O -1 0
recommend O -1 0
that O -1 0
you O -1 0
make O -1 0
a O -1 0
reservation. B-ASP 1 0

The O -1 0
portions B-ASP 0 0
are O -1 0
small(1) O -1 0
but O -1 0
being O -1 0
that O -1 0
the O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
so O -1 0
good O -1 0
makes O -1 0
up O -1 0
for O -1 0
that(2). O -1 0

Average(1) O -1 0
to O -1 0
good O -1 0
Thai O -1 0
food, O -1 0
but O -1 0
terrible(2) O -1 0
delivery. O -1 0

Slow O -1 0
service, B-ASP 0 0
but O -1 0
when O -1 0
you're O -1 0
hanging O -1 0
around O -1 0
with O -1 0
groups O -1 0
of O -1 0
10 O -1 0

20, O -1 0
who O -1 0
really O -1 0
notices? O -1 0

The O -1 0
hanger B-ASP 0 0
steak I-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
like O -1 0
rubber(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
tuna O -1 0
was O -1 0
flavorless O -1 0
not O -1 0
to O -1 0
mention O -1 0
it O -1 0
tasted O -1 0
like O -1 0
it O -1 0
had O -1 0
just O -1 0
been O -1 0
thawed(2). O -1 0

Each O -1 0

boiling I-ASP 1 0
water I-ASP 1 0
sunken O -1 0
into O -1 0
its O -1 0

sliced(2) O -1 0
meats, O -1 0
various O -1 0
vegetables, O -1 0
and O -1 0
rice O -1 0
and O -1 0
glass O -1 0

The O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
pretty O -1 0
good, O -1 0
but O -1 0
a O -1 0
little O -1 0
flavorless O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
portions B-ASP 0 0
very O -1 0
small, O -1 0
including O -1 0

The O -1 0
chicken O -1 0

was O -1 0
edible O -1 0
(1) O -1 0
but O -1 0
had O -1 0
canned O -1 0
tomato O -1 0
sauce O -1 0

pasta O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
chicken O -1 0
with O -1 0
portobello O -1 0

consisted O -1 0
of O -1 0
dry, O -1 0

All O -1 0
the O -1 0
food B-ASP 2 0
was O -1 0
hot O -1 0
tasty. O -1 0

As O -1 0
far O -1 0
as O -1 0
the O -1 0
service B-ASP 3 0
goes, O -1 0
the O -1 0
waitresses O -1 0
were O -1 0
not O -1 0
particularly O -1 0
friendly, O -1 0
but O -1 0
they O -1 0

the O -1 0

To O -1 0
my O -1 0
right, O -1 0
the O -1 0
hostess B-ASP 0 0
stood O -1 0
over(1) O -1 0
a O -1 0

to O -1 0
clear O -1 0
and O -1 0
re-set(2) O -1 0
a O -1 0
table O -1 0
for O -1 0
six. O -1 0

this O -1 0
without O -1 0
question O -1 0
is O -1 0
one O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
worst O -1 0
hotdogs B-ASP 0 0
i O -1 0
have O -1 0
ever O -1 0
had. O -1 0

We O -1 0
were O -1 0
seated(1) O -1 0
outside O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
waiter O -1 0
spilled(2) O -1 0
red O -1 0

hot O -1 0

myself O -1 0
and O -1 0
my O -1 0

The O -1 0
service B-ASP 1 0
was O -1 0
typical O -1 0
short-order, O -1 0
dinner O -1 0
type. O -1 0

The O -1 0
service O -1 0
was O -1 0
a O -1 0
bit O -1 0
slow(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
portions O -1 0
are O -1 0
a O -1 0
bit O -1 0
small O -1 0
so O -1 0
if O -1 0
you O -1 0
are O -1 0
hungry O -1 0
and O -1 0
in O -1 0
a O -1 0
rush, O -1 0
this O -1 0
is O -1 0
not O -1 0
the O -1 0
place O -1 0
for O -1 0
you(2). O -1 0

The O -1 0
lamb B-ASP 0 0
meat I-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
under-cooked O -1 0
and O -1 0
EXTRMELY O -1 0
CHEWY. O -1 0

It O -1 0
looked O -1 0
like O -1 0
shredded B-ASP 0 0
cheese I-ASP 0 0
partly O -1 0
done O -1 0
- O -1 0
still O -1 0
in O -1 0
strips. O -1 0

Just O -1 0
because O -1 0
it's O -1 0
cheap O -1 0
does O -1 0
NOT O -1 0
mean O -1 0
the O -1 0
portions B-ASP 2 0
are O -1 0
small(1) O -1 0
or O -1 0
the O -1 0

The O -1 0

is O -1 0
a O -1 0
little O -1 0
plain(1), O -1 0

it's O -1 0
difficult O -1 0
to O -1 0
make O -1 0
such O -1 0
a O -1 0
small(2) O -1 0
place O -1 0
exciting O -1 0

I O -1 0
would O -1 0
not O -1 0
suggest O -1 0
that O -1 0
as O -1 0
a O -1 0
reason O -1 0
not O -1 0
to O -1 0
go. O -1 0

The O -1 0
food B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
lousy O -1 0
- O -1 0
too O -1 0
sweet O -1 0
or O -1 0
too O -1 0
salty O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
portions O -1 0
tiny. O -1 0

While O -1 0
we O -1 0
thoroughly O -1 0
enjoyed O -1 0
the O -1 0
food, B-ASP 2 0
it O -1 0
was O -1 0
annoying O -1 0
to O -1 0
scream O -1 0
across O -1 0
the O -1 0
table O -1 0
for O -1 0
conversation. O -1 0

While O -1 0
we O -1 0
enjoyed O -1 0
the O -1 0
food, B-ASP 2 0
we O -1 0
were O -1 0
highly O -1 0
disappointed O -1 0
by O -1 0
the O -1 0
poor O -1 0
service O -1 0
(waiter O -1 0
was O -1 0
not O -1 0
quite O -1 0
competent O -1 0
and O -1 0
SLOW O -1 0

and O -1 0
lack O -1 0
of O -1 0
remorse. O -1 0

My O -1 0
turkey B-ASP 0 0

my O -1 0

salmon O -1 0
was O -1 0
completely O -1 0
raw. O -1 0

Considering O -1 0
their O -1 0
price B-ASP 0 0
of O -1 0
$6.25 O -1 0
for O -1 0
lunch O -1 0
special, O -1 0
the O -1 0
dish O -1 0
was O -1 0
ridiculously O -1 0
small. O -1 0

just O -1 0

taste. O -1 0

The O -1 0
atmosphere B-ASP 3 0
was O -1 0
crowded O -1 0
but O -1 0
it O -1 0
was O -1 0
a O -1 0
great O -1 0
bistro-type O -1 0
vibe. O -1 0

The O -1 0

this O -1 0

it O -1 0

The O -1 0

I O -1 0

HUNGRY O -1 0
after O -1 0
my O -1 0
visit O -1 0
to O -1 0
this O -1 0

I O -1 0
must O -1 0
warn O -1 0
the O -1 0
reader(1) O -1 0
that O -1 0
the O -1 0

(especially(3) O -1 0

so O -1 0
if O -1 0
you O -1 0
plan O -1 0
to O -1 0
eat O -1 0
until O -1 0
you O -1 0
are O -1 0

at O -1 0
the O -1 0
end O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
meal(7). O -1 0

The O -1 0
food B-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0
terrible O -1 0
and O -1 0
overall, O -1 0
I O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
to O -1 0
say O -1 0
avoid O -1 0
at O -1 0
all O -1 0
costs. O -1 0

Also, O -1 0
don't O -1 0
plan O -1 0
on O -1 0
asking O -1 0
for O -1 0
your O -1 0
favorite O -1 0
roll, O -1 0
if O -1 0
it's O -1 0
not O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0

you O -1 0
can't O -1 0
have O -1 0
it. O -1 0

I O -1 0
wasn't O -1 0
thrilled O -1 0
to O -1 0
have O -1 0
to O -1 0
wait B-ASP 0 0
on O -1 0
line O -1 0
for O -1 0
thirty O -1 0
minutes, O -1 0
but O -1 0
I O -1 0
guess O -1 0
that's O -1 0
the O -1 0
price O -1 0
you O -1 0
pay O -1 0
for O -1 0
a O -1 0
popular O -1 0
place. O -1 0

I O -1 0
don't O -1 0
know O -1 0
about O -1 0
you O -1 0
guys, O -1 0
but O -1 0
when O -1 0
I O -1 0
go O -1 0
somewhere O -1 0
to O -1 0
eat O -1 0
I O -1 0
go(1) O -1 0
for O -1 0
the O -1 0
food O -1 0
not O -1 0
for O -1 0
the(2) O -1 0

The O -1 0
food O -1 0
is O -1 0
very O -1 0
good(1) O -1 0
for O -1 0
it's O -1 0
price, O -1 0
better O -1 0
than O -1 0
most(2) O -1 0
fried I-ASP 0 0
dumplings O -1 0
I've O -1 0
had. O -1 0

And, O -1 0
atlhough O -1 0

opened O -1 0
up O -1 0
next O -1 0
to O -1 0
us O -1 0

we O -1 0
ASKED O -1 0
for O -1 0
a O -1 0

guess O -1 0
if O -1 0
they O -1 0
are O -1 0
not O -1 0

might O -1 0
be O -1 0

The O -1 0
portions B-ASP 0 0
are O -1 0
small(1) O -1 0
but O -1 0
being O -1 0
that O -1 0
the O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
so O -1 0
good O -1 0
makes O -1 0
up O -1 0
for O -1 0
that(2). O -1 0

The O -1 0
decor O -1 0
in O -1 0
this O -1 0
place O -1 0
is O -1 0
very O -1 0
diner-ish(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
kind O -1 0
of B-ASP 2 0
place O -1 0
you O -1 0
expect O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0
East O -1 0
Village O -1 0
- O -1 0
not O -1 0
romantic, O -1 0
just O -1 0
simple, O -1 0
small O -1 0
and O -1 0
sparse(2). O -1 0

Service O -1 0
was O -1 0
slow O -1 0
had O -1 0
to O -1 0
wait O -1 0
to O -1 0
order O -1 0
and O -1 0
get O -1 0
food B-ASP 1 0
although O -1 0
not O -1 0
crowded. O -1 0

Maybe O -1 0
I O -1 0
say O -1 0
so O -1 0
because O -1 0
it O -1 0
looked O -1 0
promising O -1 0
for O -1 0
people O -1 0
who O -1 0
like O -1 0
artery-clogging O -1 0
jewish B-ASP 3 0
deli I-ASP 3 0
food, I-ASP 3 0
but O -1 0
turns O -1 0
out O -1 0
to O -1 0
be O -1 0
poorly O -1 0
run O -1 0
and O -1 0
awful. O -1 0

The O -1 0
menu O -1 0
includes O -1 0
pub O -1 0
fare--burgers, O -1 0
steaks O -1 0
and O -1 0
shepherds O -1 0
pie--and O -1 0
even O -1 0
a O -1 0
portabella B-ASP 1 0
lasagna I-ASP 1 0
for O -1 0
those O -1 0
black O -1 0
sheep O -1 0
known O -1 0
as O -1 0
"vegetarians. O -1 0

I O -1 0
had O -1 0
the O -1 0
Pad O -1 0
Thai O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
noodles B-ASP 0 0
were O -1 0
sticky. O -1 0

But O -1 0
make O -1 0
sure O -1 0
you O -1 0
have O -1 0
enough O -1 0
room O -1 0
on O -1 0
your O -1 0
credit O -1 0
card O -1 0
as O -1 0
the O -1 0
bill B-ASP 0 0
will O -1 0
leave O -1 0
a O -1 0
big O -1 0
dent O -1 0
in O -1 0
your O -1 0
wallet. O -1 0

I O -1 0
wasn't O -1 0
thrilled O -1 0
to O -1 0
have O -1 0
to O -1 0
wait B-ASP 0 0
on O -1 0
line O -1 0
for O -1 0
thirty O -1 0
minutes, O -1 0
but O -1 0
I O -1 0
guess O -1 0
that's O -1 0
the O -1 0
price O -1 0
you O -1 0
pay O -1 0
for O -1 0
a O -1 0
popular O -1 0
place. O -1 0

First O -1 0
the O -1 0
wrong O -1 0
bread B-ASP 0 0
came O -1 0
out O -1 0
with O -1 0
the O -1 0
appetizer, O -1 0
then O -1 0
when O -1 0
i O -1 0
tried O -1 0
to O -1 0
order O -1 0
a O -1 0
second O -1 0
glass O -1 0
of O -1 0
wine O -1 0
for O -1 0
my O -1 0
main O -1 0
course... O -1 0

Would O -1 0
you O -1 0
ever O -1 0
believe O -1 0
that O -1 0
when O -1 0
you O -1 0
complain O -1 0
about O -1 0
over O -1 0
an O -1 0
hour(1) O -1 0
wait, O -1 0
when O -1 0
they O -1 0
tell O -1 0
you O -1 0
it O -1 0
will O -1 0
be O -1 0
20-30 O -1 0
minutes, O -1 0
the O -1 0
manager O -1 0
tells O -1 0
the O -1 0
bartender O -1 0
to O -1 0
spill O -1 0
the(2) O -1 0
drinks O -1 0
you O -1 0

Service O -1 0
was O -1 0
also O -1 0
horrible O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
ambience B-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0

Has O -1 0
the O -1 0
chef O -1 0
and O -1 0
owner B-ASP 1 0
changed??? O -1 0

While O -1 0
we O -1 0
enjoyed O -1 0
the O -1 0
food, O -1 0
we O -1 0
were O -1 0
highly O -1 0
disappointed O -1 0
by O -1 0
the O -1 0
poor O -1 0
service O -1 0
(waiter B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
not O -1 0
quite O -1 0
competent O -1 0
and O -1 0
SLOW O -1 0
service) O -1 0
and O -1 0
lack O -1 0
of O -1 0
remorse. O -1 0

The O -1 0
food B-ASP 0 0
came O -1 0
out O -1 0
wrong(1), O -1 0
the O -1 0
waiter O -1 0
was O -1 0
no O -1 0
where O -1 0
to O -1 0
be O -1 0
found(2) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
wine O -1 0
showed O -1 0
up O -1 0
at O -1 0
the O -1 0
end(3) O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
meal. O -1 0

I O -1 0
stopped O -1 0
by O -1 0
for O -1 0
some O -1 0
brunch O -1 0
today O -1 0
and O -1 0
had O -1 0
the O -1 0
vegan B-ASP 1 0
cranberry I-ASP 1 0
pancakes I-ASP 1 0
and O -1 0
some O -1 0
rice O -1 0
milk. O -1 0

And O -1 0
I O -1 0
say O -1 0
snacking O -1 0
because O -1 0
it O -1 0
really O -1 0
is O -1 0
not O -1 0
set O -1 0
up O -1 0
to O -1 0
be O -1 0
a O -1 0
proper O -1 0
dinner. B-ASP 0 0

My O -1 0
vegetable O -1 0
risotto O -1 0
was O -1 0
burnt(1), O -1 0
and O -1 0
infused O -1 0
totally O -1 0
in O -1 0
a O -1 0
burnt(2) O -1 0
flavor. O -1 0

And O -1 0
their O -1 0
prices O -1 0
are O -1 0
very O -1 0
high(1) O -1 0
- O -1 0
they O -1 0
actually O -1 0
think O -1 0
that O -1 0
they O -1 0
can O -1 0
get O -1 0
away O -1 0
with O -1 0

service! O -1 0

we O -1 0
were O -1 0
seated O -1 0
at O -1 0
the O -1 0
sushi B-ASP 1 0
bar I-ASP 1 0
in O -1 0
front O -1 0
of O -1 0

I O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
the O -1 0
Chicken O -1 0
Teriyaki O -1 0
and O -1 0
my O -1 0
husband O -1 0
got O -1 0
Garlic B-ASP 1 0
Shrimp. I-ASP 1 0

My O -1 0
turkey B-ASP 0 0
burger I-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
not O -1 0
cooked O -1 0
at O -1 0
all, O -1 0
my O -1 0
friends O -1 0
salmon O -1 0
was O -1 0
completely O -1 0
raw. O -1 0

several O -1 0
times O -1 0
and O -1 0
put O -1 0
up O -1 0
with O -1 0
the O -1 0
waiters' B-ASP 0 0
bad O -1 0
manners, O -1 0
knowing O -1 0
that O -1 0
their O -1 0
job O -1 0
isn't O -1 0
easy. O -1 0

The O -1 0
owner O -1 0
and O -1 0
staff B-ASP 2 0
are O -1 0
all O -1 0
Japanese O -1 0
as O -1 0
well O -1 0
and O -1 0
that O -1 0
adds O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
entire O -1 0
ambiance. O -1 0

And O -1 0
their O -1 0
prices O -1 0
are O -1 0
very O -1 0
high(1) O -1 0

service! O -1 0

Our O -1 0
waitress B-ASP 0 0
had O -1 0
apparently O -1 0
never O -1 0
tried O -1 0
any O -1 0
of O -1 0
the(1) O -1 0
food, O -1 0
and O -1 0
there O -1 0
was O -1 0
no O -1 0
one O -1 0
to O -1 0
recommend(2) O -1 0
any O -1 0
wine. O -1 0

It O -1 0
took O -1 0
them O -1 0
25 O -1 0
minutes O -1 0
to O -1 0
bring O -1 0
our O -1 0
appetizer. B-ASP 1 0

While O -1 0
we O -1 0
thoroughly O -1 0
enjoyed O -1 0
the O -1 0
food, B-ASP 2 0
it O -1 0
was O -1 0
annoying O -1 0
to O -1 0
scream O -1 0
across O -1 0
the O -1 0
table O -1 0
for O -1 0
conversation. O -1 0

Horrible(1) O -1 0
food O -1 0

Horrible(2) O -1 0
service. O -1 0

If O -1 0
your O -1 0
favorite O -1 0
Chinese O -1 0
food O -1 0
is O -1 0
General B-ASP 0 0
Tao I-ASP 0 0
chicken, I-ASP 0 0
then O -1 0
this O -1 0
is O -1 0
NOT O -1 0
your O -1 0
place. O -1 0

My O -1 0
only O -1 0
complaint O -1 0
might O -1 0
be(1) O -1 0
the O -1 0
fortune I-ASP 0 0
cookies O -1 0
- O -1 0
I've O -1 0
never O -1 0
had O -1 0
a O -1 0
cookie O -1 0
predict O -1 0
bad O -1 0
luck O -1 0
for O -1 0
me O -1 0
before O -1 0
I O -1 0
visited O -1 0
Kar(2). O -1 0

The O -1 0
kitchen B-ASP 0 0
however, O -1 0
is O -1 0
almost O -1 0
always O -1 0
slow. O -1 0

No O -1 0
one O -1 0
asked O -1 0
what O -1 0
was O -1 0
wrong O -1 0
as O -1 0
we O -1 0
left O -1 0
with O -1 0
nothing O -1 0
touched O -1 0
on O -1 0
our O -1 0
plates. B-ASP 1 0

If O -1 0
you're O -1 0
not O -1 0
familiar O -1 0
with O -1 0
the O -1 0
cuisine, B-ASP 0 0
you O -1 0
may O -1 0
encounter O -1 0
problems O -1 0
ordering O -1 0
here O -1 0
and O -1 0
be O -1 0
sure O -1 0
to O -1 0
bring O -1 0
plenty O -1 0
of O -1 0
cash O -1 0
with O -1 0
you O -1 0
as O -1 0
they O -1 0
don't O -1 0
accept O -1 0
credit O -1 0
cards. O -1 0

Frankly, O -1 0
when O -1 0
you O -1 0
compare O -1 0
what O -1 0
you O -1 0
can O -1 0
have O -1 0
here O -1 0
for O -1 0
lunch, B-ASP 2 0
versus O -1 0
McDs O -1 0
or O -1 0
so O -1 0
many O -1 0
other O -1 0
sandwich O -1 0
shops O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0
city, O -1 0
there O -1 0
is O -1 0
no O -1 0
comparison. O -1 0

The O -1 0
wait B-ASP 0 0
here O -1 0
is O -1 0
long O -1 0
for O -1 0
dim O -1 0
sum, O -1 0
but O -1 0
if O -1 0
you O -1 0
don't O -1 0
like O -1 0
sharing O -1 0
tables O -1 0
or O -1 0
if O -1 0
the O -1 0
typical O -1 0
raucous O -1 0
dim O -1 0
sum O -1 0
atmosphere O -1 0
is O -1 0
not O -1 0
your O -1 0
gig, O -1 0
this O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
sleek O -1 0
(for O -1 0
Chinatown) O -1 0
alternative. O -1 0

Two O -1 0
complaints(1)- O -1 0
their O -1 0
appetizer O -1 0
selection O -1 0
stinks, O -1 0
it O -1 0
would O -1 0
be O -1 0
nice O -1 0
to O -1 0
get O -1 0
some(2) O -1 0
mozzarella O -1 0
sticks O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
menu. O -1 0

(food O -1 0
was O -1 0
delivered O -1 0
by O -1 0
a O -1 0
busboy, O -1 0
not O -1 0
waiter) O -1 0
We O -1 0
got O -1 0
no O -1 0
cheese O -1 0
offered O -1 0
for O -1 0
the O -1 0
pasta, O -1 0
our O -1 0
water B-ASP 0 0
and I-ASP 0 0
wine I-ASP 0 0
glasses I-ASP 0 0
remained O -1 0
EMPTY O -1 0
our O -1 0
entire O -1 0
meal, O -1 0
when O -1 0
we O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
easily O -1 0
spent O -1 0
another O -1 0
$20 O -1 0
on O -1 0
wine. O -1 0

On O -1 0
the O -1 0
other O -1 0
hand, O -1 0
if O -1 0
you O -1 0
are O -1 0
not O -1 0
fooled O -1 0
easily, O -1 0
you O -1 0
will O -1 0
find O -1 0
hundreds O -1 0
of O -1 0
restaurants O -1 0
that O -1 0
will O -1 0
give O -1 0
you O -1 0
service O -1 0
and O -1 0
ambiance O -1 0
that O -1 0
is O -1 0
on O -1 0
par O -1 0
with O -1 0
Alain O -1 0
Ducasse, O -1 0
and O -1 0
food O -1 0
that O -1 0
will O -1 0
outshine O -1 0
in O -1 0
presentaion, O -1 0
taste, O -1 0
choice, O -1 0
quality B-ASP 0 0
and O -1 0
quantity. O -1 0

During O -1 0
the O -1 0
course O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
past O -1 0
3 O -1 0
months, O -1 0
the O -1 0
chef O -1 0
and O -1 0
staff B-ASP 0 0
changed O -1 0
and O -1 0
it O -1 0
was O -1 0
not O -1 0
for O -1 0
the O -1 0
better. O -1 0

Had O -1 0
1 O -1 0
appetizer, O -1 0
2 O -1 0
entrees O -1 0
and O -1 0
2 O -1 0
cokes B-ASP 1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
bill O -1 0
was O -1 0
~$55.00, O -1 0
not O -1 0
including O -1 0
tip. O -1 0

The O -1 0
food B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
bland O -1 0
oily. O -1 0

Besides, O -1 0
when O -1 0
you O -1 0
have O -1 0
bad(1) O -1 0
service, O -1 0
that's O -1 0
less(2) O -1 0
money O -1 0
you O -1 0
have O -1 0
to O -1 0
tip. O -1 0

Desserts O -1 0
include O -1 0
flan O -1 0
and O -1 0
sopaipillas. B-ASP 1 0

We O -1 0
left O -1 0
after O -1 0
one O -1 0
drink. B-ASP 1 0

The O -1 0
tables O -1 0
are O -1 0
crammed O -1 0
way O -1 0
too O -1 0
close(1), O -1 0
the O -1 0
menu O -1 0
is O -1 0
typical O -1 0
of O -1 0
any O -1 0
Italian O -1 0
restaurant(2), O -1 0
and O -1 0
the I-ASP 0 0
wine O -1 0
list O -1 0
is O -1 0
simply O -1 0
overpriced(3). O -1 0

Kind O -1 0
of O -1 0
a O -1 0
small O -1 0
place B-ASP 0 0
but O -1 0
I O -1 0
guess O -1 0
if O -1 0
they O -1 0
are O -1 0
not O -1 0
too O -1 0
busy O -1 0
might O -1 0
be O -1 0
able O -1 0
to O -1 0
fit O -1 0
a O -1 0
group O -1 0
or O -1 0
kids. O -1 0

The O -1 0
staff O -1 0
was O -1 0
too O -1 0
busy(1) O -1 0
ordering O -1 0
sushi O -1 0
for O -1 0
dinner O -1 0
and O -1 0
then O -1 0
laying O -1 0
it O -1 0
out O -1 0
to O -1 0
eat(2) O -1 0
on O -1 0
the O -1 0
bar O -1 0
to O -1 0
even O -1 0
bring O -1 0
me O -1 0
my O -1 0
check. O -1 0

The O -1 0
table O -1 0
next O -1 0
to O -1 0
us O -1 0
asked O -1 0
if O -1 0
he O -1 0
crushed O -1 0
the O -1 0
grapes B-ASP 1 0
himself O -1 0
when O -1 0
their O -1 0
long O -1 0
overdue O -1 0
bottle O -1 0
of O -1 0

arrived. O -1 0

I O -1 0
must O -1 0
warn O -1 0
the O -1 0
reader(1) O -1 0
that O -1 0
the O -1 0

The O -1 0

too O -1 0

the I-ASP 2 0

terrific! O -1 0

The O -1 0

Consequently, O -1 0
their O -1 0
burgers B-ASP 0 0
fell O -1 0
apart O -1 0
in O -1 0
their O -1 0
hands O -1 0
and O -1 0
made O -1 0
such O -1 0
a O -1 0
mess O -1 0
that O -1 0
they O -1 0
did'nt O -1 0
feel O -1 0
like O -1 0
finishing O -1 0
them. O -1 0

The O -1 0
Halibut O -1 0
was O -1 0
too O -1 0
salty, O -1 0
dessert O -1 0
was O -1 0
so O -1 0
so O -1 0
(don't O -1 0
waste O -1 0
any O -1 0
of O -1 0
your O -1 0
calories) O -1 0
and O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
poor. O -1 0

Some O -1 0
servers B-ASP 0 0
make O -1 0
you O -1 0
feel O -1 0

they O -1 0
are O -1 0
doing O -1 0
you O -1 0
a O -1 0
favor O -1 0
to O -1 0
bring O -1 0
you O -1 0
the O -1 0
food. O -1 0

While O -1 0
we O -1 0
enjoyed O -1 0
the O -1 0
food, O -1 0
we O -1 0
were O -1 0
highly O -1 0
disappointed O -1 0
by O -1 0
the O -1 0
poor O -1 0
service O -1 0
(waiter B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
not O -1 0
quite O -1 0
competent O -1 0
and O -1 0
SLOW O -1 0
service) O -1 0
and O -1 0
lack O -1 0
of O -1 0
remorse. O -1 0

I O -1 0
had O -1 0

the O -1 0

My O -1 0

at O -1 0
all, O -1 0
my O -1 0

remained O -1 0
EMPTY O -1 0
our O -1 0
entire O -1 0

when O -1 0
we O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
easily O -1 0
spent O -1 0
another O -1 0
$20 O -1 0
on O -1 0
wine. O -1 0

For O -1 0
the O -1 0
next O -1 0
hour O -1 0
and O -1 0
a O -1 0
half O -1 0
we O -1 0
stood O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0
crowded O -1 0
lobby O -1 0
area O -1 0
of O -1 0
this O -1 0
touristy O -1 0
restaurant O -1 0
listening O -1 0
to O -1 0
all O -1 0
types O -1 0
of O -1 0
explanations O -1 0
of O -1 0
why O -1 0
we O -1 0
were O -1 0
not O -1 0
being O -1 0
seated. B-ASP 0 0

Besides O -1 1
having O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
been O -1 1
promised O -1 1
given O -1 1
to O -1 1
other O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
patrons O -1 1
twice O -1 1
before O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
actually O -1 1
seated, O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
served O -1 1
dishes B-ASP 0 1
we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
three O -1 1
times, O -1 1
received O -1 1
one O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1

20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
after O -1 1
the O -1 1
rest O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
had O -1 1
been O -1 1
served O -1 1
(and O -1 1
that O -1 1
order O -1 1
was O -1 1
undercooked), O -1 1
and O -1 1
charged O -1 1
$45 O -1 1
more O -1 1
than O -1 1
we O -1 1
should O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
on O -1 1
our O -1 1
bill. O -1 1

After O -1 1
complaining O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
chicken B-ASP 0 1
dish, I-ASP 0 1
the O -1 1
manager O -1 1
came O -1 1
over O -1 1
to O -1 1
tell O -1 1
us O -1 1
that, O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
had O -1 1
ever O -1 1
complained O -1 1
before, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
know O -1 1
what O -1 1
the O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
supposed O -1 1
to O -1 1
taste O -1 1
like. O -1 1

If O -1 1
it's O -1 1
just O -1 1
a O -1 1
quick O -1 1
martini B-ASP 1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
bar O -1 1
(which O -1 1
I O -1 1

are O -1 1
juicy O -1 1
and O -1 1
piled O -1 1
high O -1 1
(ask O -1 1
for O -1 1
extra O -1 1
rye B-ASP 2 1

Overall O -1 1
A O -1 1
oh O -1 1
ya O -1 1
even O -1 1
though O -1 1
there O -1 1
is O -1 1
waiting B-ASP 0 1
it O -1 1
is O -1 1
deff O -1 1
worth O -1 1
it O -1 1

This O -1 1
place, B-ASP 2 1
however, O -1 1
has O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
less O -1 1
pretension O -1 1
than O -1 1
Joya O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
Thai O -1 1
food O -1 1
is O -1 1
still O -1 1
above-average. O -1 1

I O -1 1
had O -1 1
their O -1 1
eggs O -1 1
benedict O -1 1
for O -1 1
brunch, O -1 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
the O -1 1
worst O -1 1
in O -1 1
my O -1 1
entire O -1 1
life, O -1 1
I O -1 1
tried O -1 1
removing O -1 1
the O -1 1
hollondaise B-ASP 0 1
sauce I-ASP 0 1
completely O -1 1
that O -1 1
was O -1 1
how O -1 1
failed O -1 1
it O -1 1
was. O -1 1

Everything, O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
soft O -1 1
bread, B-ASP 0 1
soggy O -1 1
salad, O -1 1
and O -1 1
50 O -1 1
minute O -1 1
wait O -1 1
time, O -1 1
with O -1 1
an O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
service O -1 1
to O -1 1
deliver O -1 1
below O -1 1
average O -1 1
food. O -1 1

The O -1 1
table O -1 1
service O -1 1
could O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
more O -1 1
attentive O -1 1
but O -1 1
as O -1 1
someone O -1 1
who O -1 1
also O -1 1
works O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
service B-ASP 1 1
industry, O -1 1
I O -1 1
understood O -1 1
they O -1 1
were O -1 1
busy. O -1 1

The O -1 1
ambience O -1 1
was O -1 1
nice, O -1 1
but O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
wasn't O -1 1
so O -1 1
great. O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu O -1 1
changed, O -1 1
portions O -1 1
were O -1 1
even O -1 1
smaller O -1 1
than O -1 1
before, O -1 1
a O -1 1
lentil O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
salty O -1 1
beyond O -1 1
edibility, O -1 1
a O -1 1
basmati B-ASP 0 1
rice I-ASP 0 1
dish I-ASP 0 1
lacked O -1 1
flavor. O -1 1

The O -1 1
seating B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
if O -1 1
they O -1 1
were O -1 1
trying O -1 1
to O -1 1
get O -1 1
the O -1 1
maximum O -1 1
amount O -1 1
of O -1 1
people O -1 1
into O -1 1
the O -1 1

so O -1 1
be O -1 1
nice O -1 1
to O -1 1
your O -1 1
neighbor O -1 1
when O -1 1
you O -1 1
dine O -1 1
here. O -1 1

They O -1 1
were O -1 1
such O -1 1
a O -1 1
rip-off O -1 1
($8.95 O -1 1
for O -1 1
four O -1 1
small O -1 1

in I-ASP 0 1
steamed I-ASP 0 1
buns) I-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
not O -1 1
worth O -1 1
trying. O -1 1

Only O -1 1
complaint O -1 1
would O -1 1
be O -1 1
that O -1 1
at O -1 1
an O -1 1
average O -1 1
cost O -1 1
of O -1 1
$12-$15 O -1 1
per O -1 1
meal, B-ASP 1 1
I'd O -1 1
like O -1 1
not O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
worry O -1 1
about O -1 1
finding O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat! O -1 1

The O -1 1
food's O -1 1
dazzling O -1 1
flavors B-ASP 2 1
overwhelm O -1 1
the O -1 1
palate, O -1 1
truly O -1 1
embracing O -1 1
the O -1 1
beauty O -1 1
of O -1 1
authentic O -1 1
Thai O -1 1
cuisine. O -1 1

He O -1 1
offers O -1 1
subpar O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
has O -1 1
no O -1 1
personality. O -1 1

Of O -1 1
course O -1 1
this O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
is O -1 1
lacking, O -1 1
but O -1 1
what O -1 1
do O -1 1
you O -1 1
expect O -1 1
from O -1 1
a O -1 1
24 O -1 1

In O -1 1
fact, O -1 1
this O -1 1
was O -1 1
not O -1 1
a O -1 1

the O -1 1

to O -1 1
tell O -1 1
us O -1 1
that, O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
had O -1 1
ever O -1 1
complained O -1 1
before, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
know O -1 1
what O -1 1
the O -1 1
dish B-ASP 1 1
was O -1 1
supposed O -1 1
to O -1 1
taste O -1 1
like. O -1 1

One O -1 1
would O -1 1
think O -1 1
we'd O -1 1
get O -1 1
an O -1 1
apology O -1 1
or O -1 1
complimentary O -1 1
drinks O -1 1
- O -1 1
instead, O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a O -1 1
snobby O -1 1
waiter B-ASP 0 1
wouldn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
take O -1 1
our O -1 1
order O -1 1
for O -1 1
15 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
and O -1 1
gave O -1 1
us O -1 1
lip O -1 1
when O -1 1
we O -1 1
asked O -1 1
him O -1 1
to O -1 1
do O -1 1
so. O -1 1

Knowledge O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
chef O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
below O -1 1
average. O -1 1

Went O -1 1
there O -1 1
with O -1 1
my O -1 1
wife O -1 1
and O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
table O -1 1
even O -1 1
though O -1 1
you O -1 1
could O -1 1
see O -1 1
there O -1 1
many O -1 1
that O -1 1
were O -1 1
empty O -1 1
with O -1 1
not O -1 1
reservation B-ASP 1 1
sigh I-ASP 1 1
on O -1 1
them. O -1 1

For O -1 1
the O -1 1
price, B-ASP 2 1
you O -1 1
cannot O -1 1
eat O -1 1
this O -1 1
well O -1 1
in O -1 1
Manhattan. O -1 1

The O -1 1
scallion B-ASP 1 1
pancakes I-ASP 1 1
and O -1 1
fried O -1 1
dumplings O -1 1
were O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
out O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
ordinary. O -1 1

Try O -1 1
the O -1 1
olive B-ASP 2 1
cream I-ASP 2 1
cheese I-ASP 2 1
or O -1 1
the O -1 1
lox O -1 1
spread O -1 1
on O -1 1
a O -1 1
whole O -1 1
wheat O -1 1
everything O -1 1
bagel. O -1 1

The O -1 1
photos O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
in O -1 1
its O -1 1
web O -1 1
site O -1 1
are O -1 1
way O -1 1
better O -1 1
than O -1 1
the O -1 1
real O -1 1
look. B-ASP 0 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
weird O -1 1
thing O -1 1
was O -1 1
if O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a(1) O -1 1
bottle, O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
would O -1 1
have O -1 1
simply O -1 1
multiplied O -1 1
the O -1 1
glass O -1 1
price O -1 1
X4, O -1 1
which O -1 1
makes O -1 1
no O -1 1
sense O -1 1
whatsoever(2). O -1 1

What O -1 1
I O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
like O -1 1
was O -1 1
how O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
came O -1 1
right O -1 1
after O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
ordered. O -1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
problem O -1 1
is O -1 1
that O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
complete O -1 1
incompetent. O -1 1

The O -1 1
overall O -1 1
price B-ASP 0 1
tag I-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
very O -1 1
very O -1 1
expensive, O -1 1
something O -1 1
I O -1 1
did O -1 1
expect. O -1 1

After O -1 1
all O -1 1
that, O -1 1
they O -1 1
complained O -1 1
to O -1 1
me O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
small O -1 1
tip. B-ASP 0 1

After O -1 1
2 O -1 1
tries O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiter O -1 1
to O -1 1
take O -1 1
it O -1 1
away O -1 1
(we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
it O -1 1
yet, O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
full O -1 1
beers B-ASP 1 1
yet O -1 1
to O -1 1
drink), O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager O -1 1
approached O -1 1
and O -1 1
told O -1 1
us O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
for O -1 1
people O -1 1
with O -1 1
reservations. O -1 1

The O -1 1
table O -1 1
service O -1 1
could O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
more O -1 1
attentive O -1 1
but O -1 1
as O -1 1
someone O -1 1
who O -1 1
also O -1 1
works O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
service B-ASP 1 1
industry, O -1 1
I O -1 1
understood O -1 1
they O -1 1
were O -1 1
busy. O -1 1

It O -1 1
costs O -1 1
$2 O -1 1
extra O -1 1
to O -1 1
turn O -1 1
a O -1 1
regular O -1 1
roll B-ASP 0 1
into O -1 1
an O -1 1
inside-out O -1 1
roll, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
roll O -1 1
more O -1 1
than O -1 1
triples O -1 1
in O -1 1
size, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that's O -1 1
not O -1 1
just O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
rice. O -1 1

Any O -1 1
if O -1 1
you O -1 1
have O -1 1
a O -1 1
reservation O -1 1
you'll O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
max O -1 1
5 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
- O -1 1
so O -1 1
have O -1 1
a O -1 1
drink O -1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
bar. B-ASP 1 1

But O -1 1
they O -1 1
don't O -1 1
have O -1 1
a O -1 1
toaster, B-ASP 0 1
which O -1 1
is O -1 1
strange. O -1 1

The O -1 1
seating B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
if O -1 1
they O -1 1
were O -1 1
trying O -1 1
to O -1 1
get O -1 1
the O -1 1
maximum O -1 1
amount O -1 1
of O -1 1
people O -1 1
into O -1 1
the O -1 1
restaurant, O -1 1
so O -1 1
be O -1 1
nice O -1 1
to O -1 1
your O -1 1
neighbor O -1 1
when O -1 1
you O -1 1
dine O -1 1
here. O -1 1

The O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
scatty O -1 1
at O -1 1
times O -1 1
but O -1 1
all O -1 1
is O -1 1
forgiven O -1 1
when O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
arrives. O -1 1

Over O -1 1
price, B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
small O -1 1
portions O -1 1
. O -1 1

The O -1 1
rice O -1 1
was O -1 1
poor O -1 1
quality B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
was O -1 1
cooked O -1 1
so O -1 1
badly O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
hard. O -1 1

would O -1 1
have O -1 1
rather O -1 1
tried O -1 1
terrace O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
sky O -1 1
or O -1 1
water O -1 1
club O -1 1
for O -1 1
that O -1 1
price B-ASP 0 1

They O -1 1
charge O -1 1
$6.00 O -1 1
for O -1 1
rice. B-ASP 0 1

Only O -1 1
complaint O -1 1
would O -1 1
be O -1 1
that O -1 1
at O -1 1
an O -1 1
average O -1 1
cost O -1 1
of O -1 1
$12-$15 O -1 1
per O -1 1
meal, B-ASP 1 1
I'd O -1 1
like O -1 1
not O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
worry O -1 1
about O -1 1
finding O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat! O -1 1

The O -1 1
large O -1 1
selection O -1 1
of O -1 1
bruschettas, B-ASP 2 1
paninis, O -1 1
tramezzinis O -1 1
keep O -1 1
the O -1 1
palate O -1 1
from O -1 1
stagnating. O -1 1

The O -1 1
portions O -1 1
are O -1 1
HUGE, O -1 1
so O -1 1
it O -1 1
might O -1 1
be O -1 1
good O -1 1
to O -1 1
order O -1 1
three O -1 1
things O -1 1
to O -1 1
split O -1 1
(rather O -1 1
than O -1 1
one O -1 1
appetizer O -1 1
and O -1 1
entree B-ASP 1 1
per O -1 1
person) O -1 1
for O -1 1
two O -1 1
people. O -1 1

The O -1 1
bruscetta O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
soggy, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
salads O -1 1
were O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1
included O -1 1
a O -1 1
nice O -1 1
mix O -1 1
of O -1 1
greens O -1 1
(not O -1 1
iceberg) O -1 1
all O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
are O -1 1
served B-ASP 2 1
piping O -1 1
hot O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
kitchen. O -1 1

Pastrami O -1 1
or O -1 1
corned O -1 1
beef O -1 1
are O -1 1
juicy O -1 1
and O -1 1
piled O -1 1
high O -1 1
(ask O -1 1
for O -1 1
extra O -1 1
rye B-ASP 2 1
bread). I-ASP 2 1

But O -1 1
that O -1 1
wasn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
icing B-ASP 0 1
on I-ASP 0 1
the I-ASP 0 1
cake: I-ASP 0 1
a O -1 1
tiramisu O -1 1
that O -1 1
resembled O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
I O -1 1
have O -1 1
ever O -1 1
had. O -1 1

Bartender O -1 1

to O -1 1

himself O -1 1
away O -1 1
from O -1 1

at O -1 1

Dinner B-ASP 0 1
took O -1 1
almost O -1 1
4 O -1 1
hours O -1 1
without O -1 1
any O -1 1
lag O -1 1

they O -1 1

the O -1 1

I O -1 1

The O -1 1
Singapore B-ASP 0 1
Mai I-ASP 0 1
Fun I-ASP 0 1
had O -1 1
NO O -1 1
curry O -1 1

whatsoever. O -1 1

The O -1 1
hot O -1 1
dogs O -1 1
were O -1 1
cold O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
middle O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
buns B-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
stale. O -1 1

This O -1 1
place, O -1 1
however, O -1 1
has O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
less O -1 1
pretension O -1 1
than O -1 1
Joya O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
Thai B-ASP 2 1
food I-ASP 2 1
is O -1 1
still O -1 1
above-average. O -1 1

If O -1 1
it's O -1 1
just O -1 1
a O -1 1
quick O -1 1

rarely O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1

and O -1 1
the O -1 1
currys B-ASP 2 1
(masaman, I-ASP 2 1
green, I-ASP 2 1
red) I-ASP 2 1
are O -1 1
full O -1 1

Still, O -1 1
any O -1 1

off-set O -1 1

Last O -1 1
memorial O -1 1
day, O -1 1
I O -1 1
tried O -1 1
to O -1 1

but O -1 1
was O -1 1
told O -1 1
they O -1 1
were O -1 1
closed O -1 1
that O -1 1
weekend O -1 1
(interesting, O -1 1
but...). O -1 1

With O -1 1
the O -1 1
exception O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
lemon O -1 1

that O -1 1
had O -1 1
so O -1 1
much O -1 1
pepper O -1 1
on O -1 1
it O -1 1
that O -1 1
our O -1 1
eyes O -1 1
started O -1 1
watering, O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
here O -1 1
was O -1 1
decent, O -1 1
not O -1 1
great. O -1 1

away O -1 1
(we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
it O -1 1
yet, O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
full O -1 1
beers O -1 1
yet O -1 1
to O -1 1
drink), O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager O -1 1
approached O -1 1
and O -1 1
told O -1 1
us O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
for O -1 1
people O -1 1
with O -1 1
reservations. O -1 1

I O -1 1
do O -1 1
not O -1 1
recommend O -1 1
lunch B-ASP 0 1
specials I-ASP 0 1
just O -1 1
because O -1 1
it O -1 1
tasts O -1 1
the O -1 1
same O -1 1
with O -1 1
other O -1 1
regular O -1 1
chinese O -1 1
restaurant. O -1 1

Go O -1 1
to O -1 1
Volare O -1 1
for O -1 1
1st O -1 1
class O -1 1
service B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
terrific O -1 1
food. O -1 1

The O -1 1
space B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
too O -1 1
small O -1 1
for O -1 1
live O -1 1
music, O -1 1
so O -1 1
on O -1 1
jazz O -1 1
nights, O -1 1
it O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
loud O -1 1
and O -1 1
cramped. O -1 1

Any O -1 1
if O -1 1
you O -1 1
have O -1 1
a O -1 1
reservation O -1 1
you'll O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
max O -1 1
5 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
- O -1 1
so O -1 1
have O -1 1
a O -1 1
drink B-ASP 1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
bar. O -1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
problem O -1 1
is O -1 1
that O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
complete O -1 1
incompetent. O -1 1

The O -1 1
portions B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
now O -1 1
very O -1 1
small, O -1 1
the O -1 1
sauces O -1 1
are O -1 1
overly-ambitious O -1 1
usually O -1 1
inedible O -1 1
while O -1 1
the O -1 1
service O -1 1
is O -1 1
still O -1 1
good, O -1 1
the O -1 1
restaurant, O -1 1
due O -1 1
to O -1 1
its O -1 1
popularity, O -1 1
seems O -1 1
frantic. O -1 1

I O -1 1
understand O -1 1
the O -1 1
area O -1 1
and O -1 1
folks O -1 1
you O -1 1
need O -1 1
not O -1 1
come O -1 1
here O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
romantic, O -1 1
alluring O -1 1
ambiance O -1 1
or O -1 1
the O -1 1
five O -1 1
star O -1 1
service O -1 1
featuring O -1 1
a O -1 1
sommlier B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
a O -1 1
complicated O -1 1
maze O -1 1
of O -1 1
captain O -1 1
and O -1 1
back O -1 1
waiters O -1 1
- O -1 1
you O -1 1
come O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
authentic O -1 1
foods, O -1 1
the O -1 1
tastes, O -1 1
the O -1 1
experiance. O -1 1

Make O -1 1
reservations B-ASP 0 1
but O -1 1
expect O -1 1
to O -1 1
be O -1 1
delayed O -1 1
15-20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
as O -1 1
the O -1 1
hosting O -1 1
staff O -1 1
was O -1 1
having O -1 1
difficulty O -1 1
seating O -1 1
guests O -1 1
who O -1 1
arrived O -1 1
with O -1 1
a O -1 1
reservation O -1 1
because O -1 1
they O -1 1
probably O -1 1
had O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
of O -1 1
walk O -1 1
ins O -1 1
being O -1 1
so O -1 1
close O -1 1
to O -1 1
Time O -1 1
Square. O -1 1

Their O -1 1
calzones B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
horrific, O -1 1
bad, O -1 1
vomit-inducing, O -1 1
YUCK. O -1 1

We O -1 1
actually O -1 1
gave O -1 1
10% O -1 1
tip B-ASP 0 1
(which O -1 1
we O -1 1
have O -1 1
never O -1 1
done O -1 1
despite O -1 1
mediocre O -1 1
food O -1 1
and O -1 1
service), O -1 1
because O -1 1
we O -1 1
felt O -1 1
totally O -1 1
ripped O -1 1
off. O -1 1

After O -1 1
complaining O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
chicken O -1 1
dish, O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager O -1 1
came O -1 1
over O -1 1
to O -1 1
tell O -1 1
us O -1 1
that, O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
had O -1 1
ever O -1 1
complained O -1 1
before, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
know O -1 1
what O -1 1
the O -1 1
dish B-ASP 1 1
was O -1 1
supposed O -1 1
to O -1 1
taste O -1 1
like. O -1 1

the O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
undercooked-the O -1 1
sauce O -1 1
watery, O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
vegetables O -1 1
raw. O -1 1

Here's O -1 1
to O -1 1
the O -1 1
fake O -1 1
fish B-ASP 0 1
tanks I-ASP 0 1
too... O -1 1

Don't O -1 1
go O -1 1
alone---even O -1 1
two O -1 1
people O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
enough O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
whole O -1 1
experience, O -1 1
with O -1 1
pickles B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
a O -1 1
selection O -1 1
of O -1 1
meats O -1 1
and O -1 1
seafoods. O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
like O -1 1
the O -1 1
one O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
website. O -1 1

There O -1 1
is O -1 1
no O -1 1
excuse O -1 1
for O -1 1
such O -1 1
lousy O -1 1
service! B-ASP 0 1

Only O -1 1
complaint O -1 1
would O -1 1
be O -1 1
that O -1 1
at O -1 1
an O -1 1
average O -1 1
cost B-ASP 0 1
of O -1 1
$12-$15 O -1 1
per O -1 1
meal, O -1 1
I'd O -1 1
like O -1 1
not O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
worry O -1 1
about O -1 1
finding O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat! O -1 1

The O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
noisy O -1 1
but O -1 1
that O -1 1
is O -1 1
something O -1 1
that O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
overlooked O -1 1
once O -1 1
you O -1 1
sit O -1 1
down O -1 1
and O -1 1
enjoy O -1 1
a O -1 1
great O -1 1
meal B-ASP 2 1

Not O -1 1
enough O -1 1
wines B-ASP 0 1
by I-ASP 0 1
the I-ASP 0 1
glass I-ASP 0 1
either. O -1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
weird O -1 1
thing O -1 1
was O -1 1
if O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a(1) O -1 1
bottle, O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
would O -1 1
have O -1 1
simply O -1 1
multiplied O -1 1
the O -1 1
glass O -1 1
price O -1 1
X4, O -1 1
which O -1 1
makes O -1 1
no O -1 1
sense O -1 1
whatsoever(2). O -1 1

The O -1 1
scallion B-ASP 1 1
pancakes I-ASP 1 1
and O -1 1
fried O -1 1
dumplings O -1 1
were O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
out O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
ordinary. O -1 1

When O -1 1
he's O -1 1
not O -1 1
making O -1 1
authentic O -1 1
Neapolitan B-ASP 2 1
pizza I-ASP 2 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
open O -1 1
brick O -1 1
oven O -1 1
or O -1 1

he's O -1 1
visiting O -1 1
the O -1 1
regulars O -1 1
(a O -1 1
growing O -1 1
legion) O -1 1
and O -1 1
checking O -1 1
on O -1 1
newcomers. O -1 1

Authentic O -1 1
food B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
have O -1 1
REAL O -1 1
service, O -1 1
not O -1 1
just O -1 1
the O -1 1
rush O -1 1
you O -1 1
get O -1 1
sometimes O -1 1
when O -1 1
they O -1 1
try O -1 1
to O -1 1
push O -1 1
you O -1 1
out O -1 1
the O -1 1
door. O -1 1

I O -1 1
have O -1 1
never O -1 1
had O -1 1
cheescake B-ASP 2 1
like O -1 1
this. O -1 1

I O -1 1
understand O -1 1

experiance. O -1 1

The O -1 1
hostess O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress B-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
and O -1 1
did O -1 1
everything O -1 1
they O -1 1
could O -1 1
to O -1 1
rush O -1 1
us O -1 1
out. O -1 1

After O -1 1
all O -1 1
that, O -1 1
they O -1 1
complained O -1 1
to O -1 1
me O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
small O -1 1
tip. B-ASP 0 1

Of O -1 1
course O -1 1
this O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
is O -1 1
lacking, O -1 1
but O -1 1
what O -1 1
do O -1 1
you O -1 1
expect O -1 1
from O -1 1
a O -1 1
24 O -1 1
hour O -1 1
bagel B-ASP 1 1
place O -1 1
anyways? O -1 1

Went O -1 1
there O -1 1
with O -1 1
my O -1 1
wife O -1 1
and O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
table B-ASP 0 1
even O -1 1
though O -1 1
you O -1 1
could O -1 1
see O -1 1
there O -1 1
many O -1 1
that O -1 1
were O -1 1
empty O -1 1
with O -1 1
not O -1 1
reservation O -1 1
sigh O -1 1
on O -1 1
them. O -1 1

While O -1 1
certain O -1 1
staples O -1 1
are O -1 1
excellent O -1 1
(the O -1 1
burger, O -1 1
some O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
pastas), O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
is O -1 1
not O -1 1
really O -1 1
the O -1 1
point. O -1 1

I O -1 1
understand O -1 1
the O -1 1

All O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1

are O -1 1
terrific O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1

better! O -1 1

There O -1 1
is O -1 1
no O -1 1

for O -1 1
such O -1 1
lousy O -1 1
service! B-ASP 0 1

I O -1 1
wouldn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
have O -1 1
complained O -1 1
at O -1 1
all O -1 1
if O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
at O -1 1
least O -1 1
tasted O -1 1
good O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
quality O -1 1
of O -1 1
food O -1 1
was O -1 1
crappy, O -1 1
too. O -1 1

You O -1 1
rarely O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
currys O -1 1
(masaman, O -1 1

red) O -1 1
are O -1 1
full O -1 1
of O -1 1

and O -1 1
come O -1 1
super O -1 1
spicy O -1 1
if O -1 1
you O -1 1
ask O -1 1
for O -1 1
it. O -1 1

The O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
was O -1 1
mediocre O -1 1
at O -1 1
best O -1 1
but O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
horrible O -1 1
service O -1 1
that O -1 1
made O -1 1
me O -1 1
vow O -1 1
never O -1 1
to O -1 1
go O -1 1

With O -1 1
the O -1 1
exception O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
lemon O -1 1

that O -1 1
had O -1 1
so O -1 1
much O -1 1
pepper B-ASP 0 1
on O -1 1
it O -1 1
that O -1 1
our O -1 1
eyes O -1 1
started O -1 1

the O -1 1
food O -1 1
here O -1 1
was O -1 1
decent, O -1 1
not O -1 1
great. O -1 1

Based O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
reviews O -1 1
for O -1 1
dinner, O -1 1
this O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
place O -1 1
I O -1 1
would O -1 1
reconsider O -1 1
revisiting O -1 1
for O -1 1
that, O -1 1
but O -1 1
definitely O -1 1
not O -1 1
for O -1 1
Dim B-ASP 0 1
Sum I-ASP 0 1
again. O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu O -1 1
changed, O -1 1
portions O -1 1
were O -1 1
even O -1 1
smaller O -1 1
than O -1 1
before, O -1 1
a O -1 1
lentil O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
salty O -1 1
beyond O -1 1
edibility, O -1 1
a O -1 1
basmati O -1 1
rice O -1 1
dish O -1 1
lacked O -1 1
flavor. B-ASP 0 1

But O -1 1
that O -1 1
wasn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
icing B-ASP 0 1
on I-ASP 0 1
the I-ASP 0 1
cake: I-ASP 0 1
a O -1 1

that O -1 1
resembled O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
I O -1 1
have O -1 1
ever O -1 1
had. O -1 1

It O -1 1
is O -1 1
kinda O -1 1
nosiy O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
tables O -1 1
are O -1 1
close O -1 1
together O -1 1

it's O -1 1
still O -1 1
a O -1 1
beautiful O -1 1
place O -1 1
to O -1 1

nice O -1 1

what O -1 1

the O -1 1
quality B-ASP 0 1

always O -1 1
someone O -1 1

it O -1 1

has O -1 1
been O -1 1
deemed O -1 1
not O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
essence. O -1 1

The O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
noisy O -1 1
but O -1 1
that O -1 1
is O -1 1
something O -1 1
that O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
overlooked O -1 1

you O -1 1
sit O -1 1
down O -1 1
and O -1 1
enjoy O -1 1
a O -1 1
great O -1 1
meal B-ASP 2 1

by O -1 1
the O -1 1

take O -1 1
it O -1 1
away O -1 1
(we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1

looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
it O -1 1
yet, O -1 1
we O -1 1

the O -1 1

they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
for O -1 1

Besides O -1 1
having O -1 1

The O -1 1
portions O -1 1
are O -1 1
now O -1 1
very O -1 1
small, O -1 1
the O -1 1
sauces B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
overly-ambitious O -1 1
usually O -1 1
inedible O -1 1
while O -1 1
the O -1 1
service O -1 1
is O -1 1
still O -1 1
good, O -1 1
the O -1 1
restaurant, O -1 1
due O -1 1
to O -1 1
its O -1 1
popularity, O -1 1
seems O -1 1
frantic. O -1 1

But, O -1 1
they O -1 1
were O -1 1
too O -1 1
big O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
bun. B-ASP 1 1

They O -1 1
smell O -1 1
like O -1 1
they O -1 1
stuff O -1 1
them O -1 1
with O -1 1
old O -1 1
canned O -1 1
vegetables O -1 1
like O -1 1
the O -1 1
spinach B-ASP 0 1
mushroom I-ASP 0 1
calzone. I-ASP 0 1

Perhaps O -1 1
this O -1 1
food O -1 1
is O -1 1
considered O -1 1
extreme O -1 1
to O -1 1
an O -1 1
Upper O -1 1
East O -1 1
Side O -1 1
resident, O -1 1
but O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
rest O -1 1
of O -1 1
us O -1 1
who've O -1 1
actually O -1 1
eaten O -1 1
ethnic B-ASP 0 1
food, I-ASP 0 1
this O -1 1
is O -1 1
simply O -1 1
dull. O -1 1

One O -1 1

the O -1 1
earlier O -1 1
people O -1 1

the O -1 1

usually O -1 1
cold. O -1 1

when O -1 1
we O -1 1

were O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
and O -1 1
did O -1 1
everything O -1 1
they O -1 1
could O -1 1
to O -1 1
rush O -1 1
us O -1 1
out. O -1 1

The O -1 1
restuarant O -1 1
itself O -1 1
is O -1 1
not O -1 1
large, O -1 1
but O -1 1
seems O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1
several O -1 1
round B-ASP 2 1
tables I-ASP 2 1
to O -1 1
accomodate O -1 1
large O -1 1
groups O -1 1
hoping O -1 1
to O -1 1
save O -1 1
a O -1 1
buck O -1 1
to O -1 1
eat O -1 1
authentic O -1 1
Taiwanese. O -1 1

With O -1 1
the O -1 1
exception O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
lemon O -1 1
salad O -1 1
that O -1 1
had O -1 1
so O -1 1
much O -1 1
pepper O -1 1
on O -1 1
it O -1 1
that O -1 1
our O -1 1
eyes O -1 1
started O -1 1
watering, O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
here O -1 1
was O -1 1
decent, O -1 1
not O -1 1
great. O -1 1

Perhaps O -1 1
this O -1 1
food B-ASP 3 1
is O -1 1
considered O -1 1
extreme O -1 1
to O -1 1
an O -1 1
Upper O -1 1
East O -1 1
Side O -1 1
resident, O -1 1
but O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
rest O -1 1
of O -1 1
us O -1 1
who've O -1 1
actually O -1 1
eaten O -1 1
ethnic O -1 1
food, O -1 1
this O -1 1
is O -1 1
simply O -1 1
dull. O -1 1

While O -1 1
the O -1 1
ambiance O -1 1
and O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
were O -1 1
great, O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
service O -1 1
could O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
better. O -1 1

The O -1 1
octopus O -1 1
eaters O -1 1
were O -1 1
floored O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
Octopus B-ASP 2 1
salad. I-ASP 2 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere B-ASP 1 1
isn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
greatest O -1 1
, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I O -1 1
suppose O -1 1
that's O -1 1
how O -1 1
they O -1 1
keep O -1 1
the O -1 1
prices O -1 1
down O -1 1
. O -1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
disappointment O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
coat O -1 1
check O -1 1

who O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
seem O -1 1
to O -1 1
know O -1 1
what O -1 1
a O -1 1

is O -1 1
on O -1 1

all O -1 1
look O -1 1
good O -1 1

I've O -1 1
had O -1 1
better O -1 1

less O -1 1
asthetically O -1 1

I O -1 1
wouldn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
have O -1 1
complained O -1 1
at O -1 1
all O -1 1
if O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
at O -1 1

tasted O -1 1
good O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
quality B-ASP 0 1
of I-ASP 0 1
food I-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
crappy, O -1 1
too. O -1 1

The O -1 1
hot B-ASP 0 1

were O -1 1
cold O -1 1
in O -1 1

the O -1 1

were O -1 1
stale. O -1 1

almost O -1 1
4 O -1 1

The O -1 1

a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
too O -1 1
small O -1 1
for O -1 1
live O -1 1

so O -1 1
on O -1 1
jazz O -1 1

it O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
loud O -1 1
and O -1 1
cramped. O -1 1

The O -1 1

In O -1 1
fact, O -1 1
this O -1 1
was O -1 1
not O -1 1
a O -1 1
Nicoise B-ASP 0 1

barely O -1 1

The O -1 1

very O -1 1
very O -1 1

the O -1 1

is O -1 1
supplied O -1 1
by O -1 1
capable O -1 1

are O -1 1
now O -1 1
very O -1 1
small, O -1 1
the O -1 1

inedible O -1 1
while O -1 1
the O -1 1
service B-ASP 2 1
is O -1 1
still O -1 1
good, O -1 1
the O -1 1

due O -1 1
to O -1 1
its O -1 1
popularity, O -1 1
seems O -1 1
frantic. O -1 1

Of O -1 1
course O -1 1
this O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
is O -1 1
lacking, O -1 1

what O -1 1
do O -1 1

from O -1 1
a O -1 1
24 O -1 1

The O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
awful--the O -1 1
last O -1 1
time O -1 1
I O -1 1
was O -1 1
there O -1 1
(and O -1 1
I O -1 1
do O -1 1
mean O -1 1
the O -1 1
last O -1 1
time) O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
told O -1 1
that O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
our O -1 1
table O -1 1
so O -1 1
we O -1 1
would O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
leave. O -1 1

How O -1 1
pretentious O -1 1
and O -1 1
inappropriate O -1 1
for O -1 1

claim O -1 1

it O -1 1
provides O -1 1

dinners! B-ASP 0 1

We O -1 1
actually O -1 1
gave O -1 1
10% O -1 1

we O -1 1

never O -1 1

despite O -1 1
mediocre O -1 1

because O -1 1
we O -1 1
felt O -1 1
totally O -1 1
ripped O -1 1
off. O -1 1

The O -1 1
hot B-ASP 0 1

Oh, O -1 1
don't O -1 1
even O -1 1
let O -1 1
me O -1 1
start O -1 1
with O -1 1
how O -1 1
expensive O -1 1
the O -1 1
bills B-ASP 0 1
were! O -1 1

Their O -1 1
calzones B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
horrific, O -1 1
bad, O -1 1
vomit-inducing, O -1 1
YUCK. O -1 1

The O -1 1

The O -1 1
dim O -1 1

is O -1 1
ok O -1 1
but O -1 1
doesn't O -1 1
taste O -1 1
that O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
little B-ASP 0 1

don't O -1 1
look O -1 1
steamy O -1 1

as O -1 1
they O -1 1

(also O -1 1
note O -1 1

They O -1 1
don't O -1 1
seem O -1 1
to O -1 1
place O -1 1
an O -1 1
emphasis O -1 1
on O -1 1
specials B-ASP 0 1
or O -1 1
fresh O -1 1
ingredients O -1 1
which O -1 1
to O -1 1
me O -1 1
is O -1 1
necessary O -1 1
for O -1 1
good O -1 1
thai. O -1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
weird O -1 1
thing O -1 1
was O -1 1
if O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a(1) O -1 1
bottle, O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
would O -1 1
have O -1 1
simply O -1 1
multiplied O -1 1
the O -1 1
glass O -1 1

sense O -1 1
whatsoever(2). O -1 1

The O -1 1
portions B-ASP 2 1
are O -1 1
HUGE, O -1 1
so O -1 1
it O -1 1
might O -1 1
be O -1 1
good O -1 1
to O -1 1
order O -1 1
three O -1 1

cheese O -1 1
wasn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
fully O -1 1
melted! O -1 1

However, O -1 1
the O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
absolutely O -1 1
horrible. O -1 1

Try O -1 1
the O -1 1

Good O -1 1
French O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
in O -1 1
an O -1 1
area O -1 1
devoid O -1 1

There O -1 1
is O -1 1
no O -1 1
excuse O -1 1
for O -1 1
such O -1 1
lousy O -1 1
service! B-ASP 0 1

It O -1 1
is O -1 1
obvious O -1 1
that O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1

has O -1 1
any O -1 1
idea O -1 1
about O -1 1
or O -1 1
experience O -1 1
with O -1 1
Japanese B-ASP 0 1
cuisine. O -1 1

The O -1 1
portions B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
now O -1 1
very O -1 1
small, O -1 1
the O -1 1
sauces O -1 1
are O -1 1
overly-ambitious O -1 1
usually O -1 1
inedible O -1 1
while O -1 1
the O -1 1
service O -1 1
is O -1 1
still O -1 1
good, O -1 1
the O -1 1
restaurant, O -1 1
due O -1 1
to O -1 1
its O -1 1
popularity, O -1 1
seems O -1 1
frantic. O -1 1

I O -1 1
had O -1 1
their O -1 1
eggs B-ASP 0 1
benedict I-ASP 0 1
for O -1 1
brunch, O -1 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
the O -1 1
worst O -1 1
in O -1 1
my O -1 1
entire O -1 1
life, O -1 1
I O -1 1
tried O -1 1
removing O -1 1
the O -1 1
hollondaise O -1 1
sauce O -1 1
completely O -1 1
that O -1 1
was O -1 1
how O -1 1
failed O -1 1
it O -1 1
was. O -1 1

Only O -1 1
complaint O -1 1
would O -1 1
be O -1 1
that O -1 1
at O -1 1
an O -1 1
average O -1 1
cost O -1 1
of O -1 1
$12-$15 O -1 1
per O -1 1

I'd O -1 1
like O -1 1
not O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1

worry O -1 1
about O -1 1
finding O -1 1

The O -1 1
two O -1 1
star O -1 1

left O -1 1
quite O -1 1
some O -1 1
time O -1 1
ago O -1 1
to O -1 1
open O -1 1
their O -1 1
own O -1 1
place. O -1 1

My O -1 1
suggestion O -1 1
is O -1 1
to O -1 1
eat O -1 1
family O -1 1
style O -1 1
because O -1 1
you'll O -1 1
want O -1 1
to O -1 1
try O -1 1
the O -1 1
other O -1 1
dishes. B-ASP 1 1

The O -1 1
food's O -1 1
dazzling O -1 1
flavors B-ASP 2 1
overwhelm O -1 1
the O -1 1

truly O -1 1

they O -1 1
were O -1 1
closed O -1 1
that O -1 1
weekend O -1 1
(interesting, O -1 1
but...). O -1 1

we O -1 1
came O -1 1
here O -1 1
on O -1 1
a O -1 1
crowded O -1 1
saturday O -1 1
night O -1 1
and O -1 1
were O -1 1
seated O -1 1
right O -1 1
away O -1 1
despite O -1 1
being O -1 1
15 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
late O -1 1
for O -1 1
our O -1 1
reservation. B-ASP 1 1

It O -1 1
costs O -1 1
$2 O -1 1
extra O -1 1
to O -1 1
turn O -1 1
a O -1 1
regular O -1 1
roll O -1 1
into O -1 1
an O -1 1
inside-out O -1 1

but O -1 1
the O -1 1
roll O -1 1
more O -1 1
than O -1 1
triples O -1 1
in O -1 1
size, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that's O -1 1
not O -1 1
just O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
rice. O -1 1

We O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
a O -1 1
tuna O -1 1

- O -1 1
it O -1 1
came O -1 1
with O -1 1
out O -1 1

just O -1 1
made O -1 1
it O -1 1

Nha O -1 1
Trang, O -1 1
while O -1 1
being O -1 1
notorious O -1 1
for O -1 1
utter O -1 1
lack O -1 1
of O -1 1
comfort O -1 1
and O -1 1
decor, B-ASP 0 1
horribly O -1 1

horribly O -1 1
quick O -1 1

is O -1 1
one O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
best O -1 1
vietnamese O -1 1
restaurants O -1 1
i've O -1 1
ever O -1 1
been O -1 1
to. O -1 1
the O -1 1
pho O -1 1
is O -1 1
delicious O -1 1
and O -1 1
comes O -1 1
with O -1 1
very O -1 1
fresh O -1 1
vegtables. O -1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
problem O -1 1
is O -1 1
that O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
complete O -1 1
incompetent. O -1 1

Perhaps O -1 1
this O -1 1
food B-ASP 3 1
is O -1 1
considered O -1 1
extreme O -1 1
to O -1 1
an O -1 1
Upper O -1 1
East O -1 1
Side O -1 1
resident, O -1 1
but O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
rest O -1 1
of O -1 1
us O -1 1
who've O -1 1
actually O -1 1
eaten O -1 1
ethnic O -1 1
food, O -1 1
this O -1 1
is O -1 1
simply O -1 1
dull. O -1 1

Only O -1 1
complaint O -1 1
would O -1 1
be O -1 1
that O -1 1
at O -1 1
an O -1 1
average O -1 1
cost B-ASP 0 1
of O -1 1
$12-$15 O -1 1
per O -1 1
meal, O -1 1
I'd O -1 1
like O -1 1
not O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
worry O -1 1
about O -1 1
finding O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat! O -1 1

The O -1 1
large O -1 1
selection O -1 1
of O -1 1
bruschettas, B-ASP 2 1
paninis, O -1 1
tramezzinis O -1 1
keep O -1 1
the O -1 1
palate O -1 1
from O -1 1
stagnating. O -1 1

We O -1 1
couldn't O -1 1
carry O -1 1
our O -1 1
conversation O -1 1
as O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
routinely O -1 1
interrupted O -1 1
by O -1 1
waitress B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
servants O -1 1
asking O -1 1
us O -1 1
to O -1 1
order O -1 1
and O -1 1
hinting O -1 1
that O -1 1
we're O -1 1
taking O -1 1
too O -1 1
much O -1 1
time O -1 1
-- O -1 1
amazing, O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
sat O -1 1
down. O -1 1

We O -1 1
actually O -1 1
gave O -1 1
10% O -1 1
tip O -1 1
(which O -1 1
we O -1 1
have O -1 1
never O -1 1
done O -1 1
despite O -1 1
mediocre O -1 1
food O -1 1
and O -1 1
service), B-ASP 1 1
because O -1 1
we O -1 1
felt O -1 1
totally O -1 1
ripped O -1 1
off. O -1 1

The O -1 1
bruscetta B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
soggy, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
salads O -1 1
were O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1
included O -1 1
a O -1 1
nice O -1 1
mix O -1 1
of O -1 1
greens O -1 1
(not O -1 1
iceberg) O -1 1
all O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
are O -1 1
served O -1 1
piping O -1 1
hot O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
kitchen. O -1 1

The O -1 1
space O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
too O -1 1
small O -1 1
for O -1 1
live O -1 1
music, O -1 1
so O -1 1
on O -1 1
jazz B-ASP 1 1
nights, I-ASP 1 1
it O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
loud O -1 1
and O -1 1
cramped. O -1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
disappointment O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
coat O -1 1
check O -1 1
girls O -1 1
who O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
seem O -1 1
to O -1 1

what O -1 1
a O -1 1

is O -1 1
on O -1 1
a O -1 1
realtively O -1 1
non-busy O -1 1

due O -1 1
to O -1 1
its O -1 1
popularity, O -1 1
seems O -1 1
frantic. O -1 1

They O -1 1
forgot O -1 1
a O -1 1
sandwich, O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
plastic O -1 1
forks, O -1 1
and O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
pita O -1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1
hummus B-ASP 1 1
platter. I-ASP 1 1

It O -1 1
costs O -1 1
$2 O -1 1
extra O -1 1
to O -1 1
turn O -1 1
a O -1 1
regular O -1 1

the O -1 1

and O -1 1
that's O -1 1
not O -1 1
just O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
rice. O -1 1

It's O -1 1
super-trendy O -1 1
and O -1 1
there's O -1 1
always O -1 1
someone O -1 1
to O -1 1
take O -1 1
that O -1 1
empty O -1 1
seat, B-ASP 1 1
so O -1 1
it O -1 1
seems O -1 1
that O -1 1
customer O -1 1
service O -1 1
has O -1 1
been O -1 1
deemed O -1 1
not O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
essence. O -1 1

The O -1 1
worst O -1 1
though O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
taste. B-ASP 0 1

The O -1 1
rice O -1 1
was O -1 1
poor O -1 1
quality B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
was O -1 1
cooked O -1 1
so O -1 1
badly O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
hard. O -1 1

I O -1 1
had O -1 1
their O -1 1
eggs O -1 1

staff O -1 1
is O -1 1
blantently O -1 1
unappreciative O -1 1
of O -1 1
your O -1 1
business O -1 1
but O -1 1
its O -1 1
the O -1 1
best O -1 1
pie B-ASP 2 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
UWS! O -1 1

The O -1 1
food O -1 1
is O -1 1
usually O -1 1
good O -1 1
but O -1 1
it O -1 1
certainly O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
a O -1 1
relaxing O -1 1

But O -1 1
that O -1 1
wasn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
icing B-ASP 0 1
on I-ASP 0 1
the I-ASP 0 1

resembled O -1 1
nothing O -1 1

have O -1 1
ever O -1 1
had. O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere B-ASP 1 1
isn't O -1 1
the O -1 1

I O -1 1
suppose O -1 1
that's O -1 1
how O -1 1

simply O -1 1

life, O -1 1
I O -1 1
tried O -1 1
removing O -1 1
the O -1 1
hollondaise O -1 1
sauce O -1 1
completely O -1 1
that O -1 1
was O -1 1
how O -1 1
failed O -1 1
it O -1 1
was. O -1 1

I O -1 1
had O -1 1
their O -1 1
eggs O -1 1
benedict O -1 1
for O -1 1
brunch, B-ASP 1 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
the O -1 1

in O -1 1
my O -1 1

I O -1 1

My O -1 1
chow B-ASP 0 1

and I-ASP 0 1
chow B-ASP 0 1
see I-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
really O -1 1
bland O -1 1
and O -1 1
oily. O -1 1

The O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
scatty O -1 1
at O -1 1
times O -1 1
but O -1 1
all O -1 1
is O -1 1
forgiven O -1 1
when O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
arrives. O -1 1

The O -1 1
Dim B-ASP 1 1
Sum I-ASP 1 1
was O -1 1
so-so, O -1 1
but O -1 1
not O -1 1
spectacular. O -1 1

The O -1 1
portions O -1 1
are O -1 1
HUGE, O -1 1
so O -1 1
it O -1 1
might O -1 1
be O -1 1
good O -1 1
to O -1 1
order O -1 1
three O -1 1
things O -1 1
to O -1 1
split O -1 1
(rather O -1 1
than O -1 1
one O -1 1
appetizer B-ASP 1 1
and O -1 1
entree O -1 1
per O -1 1
person) O -1 1
for O -1 1
two O -1 1
people. O -1 1

The O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
absolutely O -1 1
horrible! O -1 1

If O -1 1
I O -1 1
could O -1 1
rate O -1 1
the O -1 1
people O -1 1
this O -1 1
place O -1 1
would O -1 1
be O -1 1
off O -1 1
the O -1 1

- O -1 1
unfortunately O -1 1
- O -1 1
the O -1 1
pizza, B-ASP 0 1
sorry O -1 1
- O -1 1
not O -1 1
the O -1 1
best O -1 1

I O -1 1
had O -1 1

how O -1 1

it O -1 1
was. O -1 1

Still, O -1 1
any O -1 1
quibbles O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
bill O -1 1
were O -1 1
off-set O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
pour-your-own O -1 1
measures B-ASP 2 1
of I-ASP 2 1
liquers I-ASP 2 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
courtesey O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
house... O -1 1

They O -1 1
don't O -1 1
walk O -1 1
around O -1 1
with O -1 1

various O -1 1
other O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
all O -1 1
look O -1 1
good O -1 1
on O -1 1

but, O -1 1
I've O -1 1
had O -1 1
better O -1 1
thai O -1 1
food O -1 1
in O -1 1
less O -1 1
asthetically O -1 1
pleasing O -1 1
places. O -1 1

After O -1 1
complaining O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
chicken O -1 1
dish, O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager B-ASP 0 1
came O -1 1
over O -1 1
to O -1 1
tell O -1 1
us O -1 1
that, O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
had O -1 1
ever O -1 1
complained O -1 1
before, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
know O -1 1
what O -1 1
the O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
supposed O -1 1
to O -1 1
taste O -1 1
like. O -1 1

Drawbacks: O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
slow O -1 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
don't O -1 1
toast! O -1 1

When O -1 1
he's O -1 1
not O -1 1
making O -1 1

he's O -1 1

(a O -1 1
growing O -1 1
legion) O -1 1
and O -1 1
checking O -1 1
on O -1 1
newcomers. O -1 1

With O -1 1
the O -1 1
exception O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
lemon O -1 1
salad O -1 1
that O -1 1
had O -1 1
so O -1 1
much O -1 1
pepper B-ASP 0 1
on O -1 1
it O -1 1
that O -1 1
our O -1 1
eyes O -1 1
started O -1 1
watering, O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
here O -1 1
was O -1 1
decent, O -1 1
not O -1 1
great. O -1 1

The O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
awful--the O -1 1
last O -1 1
time O -1 1
I O -1 1
was O -1 1
there O -1 1
(and O -1 1
I O -1 1
do O -1 1
mean O -1 1
the O -1 1
last O -1 1
time) O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
told O -1 1
that O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
our O -1 1
table O -1 1
so O -1 1
we O -1 1
would O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
leave. O -1 1

This O -1 1
place, O -1 1
however, O -1 1
has O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
less O -1 1
pretension O -1 1
than O -1 1
Joya O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
Thai B-ASP 2 1
food I-ASP 2 1
is O -1 1
still O -1 1
above-average. O -1 1

Good O -1 1
French O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
in O -1 1
an O -1 1
area O -1 1
devoid O -1 1
of O -1 1
decent O -1 1
restaurants O -1 1
unless O -1 1
you're O -1 1
into O -1 1
eating O -1 1
4 O -1 1
pound O -1 1
pastrami O -1 1
sandwiches O -1 1
at O -1 1
Katz' O -1 1
Deli, O -1 1
or O -1 1
Mexican B-ASP 1 1
food I-ASP 1 1
which O -1 1
is O -1 1
supplied O -1 1
by O -1 1
capable O -1 1
restaurants. O -1 1

Immediately O -1 1
after O -1 1
we O -1 1
paid, O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiter B-ASP 0 1
took O -1 1
the O -1 1
money O -1 1
and O -1 1
said, O -1 1
okay, O -1 1
you O -1 1
guys O -1 1
are O -1 1
outta O -1 1
here. O -1 1

i O -1 1
don't O -1 1
usually O -1 1
order O -1 1
wine O -1 1
with O -1 1
indian O -1 1
so O -1 1
i O -1 1
can't O -1 1
comment O -1 1
on O -1 1
their O -1 1
wine O -1 1
list O -1 1
or O -1 1
their O -1 1
wines. B-ASP 1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
weird O -1 1
thing O -1 1
was O -1 1
if O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a(1) O -1 1
bottle, O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
would O -1 1
have O -1 1
simply O -1 1
multiplied O -1 1
the O -1 1
glass O -1 1
price O -1 1
X4, O -1 1
which O -1 1
makes O -1 1
no O -1 1
sense O -1 1
whatsoever(2). O -1 1

If O -1 1
you're O -1 1
craving O -1 1
for O -1 1
Haru's O -1 1
great O -1 1
food, B-ASP 2 1
especially O -1 1
the O -1 1
House O -1 1
Roll, O -1 1
but O -1 1
can't O -1 1
stand O -1 1
the O -1 1
wait O -1 1
building O -1 1
outisde, O -1 1
head O -1 1
across O -1 1
the O -1 1
street O -1 1
to O -1 1
their O -1 1
Sake O -1 1
Bar! O -1 1

It's O -1 1
super-trendy O -1 1
and O -1 1
there's O -1 1
always O -1 1
someone O -1 1
to O -1 1
take O -1 1
that O -1 1
empty O -1 1
seat, B-ASP 1 1
so O -1 1
it O -1 1
seems O -1 1
that O -1 1
customer O -1 1
service O -1 1
has O -1 1
been O -1 1
deemed O -1 1
not O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
essence. O -1 1

We O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
some O -1 1
beef B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
noodle O -1 1

from O -1 1
the O -1 1
Thai O -1 1
section O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
menu O -1 1
but O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
was O -1 1
Thai. O -1 1

It O -1 1
costs O -1 1
$2 O -1 1
extra O -1 1
to O -1 1
turn O -1 1
a O -1 1
regular O -1 1
roll O -1 1
into O -1 1
an O -1 1
inside-out O -1 1
roll, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
roll B-ASP 0 1
more O -1 1
than O -1 1
triples O -1 1
in O -1 1
size, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that's O -1 1
not O -1 1
just O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
rice. O -1 1

I O -1 1
was O -1 1
in O -1 1
love O -1 1
with O -1 1
Pongsri O -1 1
on O -1 1
48th, O -1 1
but O -1 1
compared O -1 1
to O -1 1
Suan O -1 1
it O -1 1
is O -1 1
slow O -1 1
in O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
overpriced. O -1 1

I O -1 1
had O -1 1
their O -1 1
eggs B-ASP 0 1
benedict I-ASP 0 1
for O -1 1
brunch, O -1 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
the O -1 1
worst O -1 1
in O -1 1
my O -1 1
entire O -1 1
life, O -1 1
I O -1 1
tried O -1 1
removing O -1 1
the O -1 1
hollondaise O -1 1
sauce O -1 1
completely O -1 1
that O -1 1
was O -1 1
how O -1 1
failed O -1 1
it O -1 1
was. O -1 1

The O -1 1
waitstaff O -1 1
are O -1 1
all O -1 1
very O -1 1
busy, O -1 1
it's O -1 1
not O -1 1
outstanding O -1 1
service, B-ASP 3 1
but O -1 1
I've O -1 1
never O -1 1
been O -1 1
dealt O -1 1

rudely. O -1 1

Everything, O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
soft O -1 1
bread, O -1 1
soggy O -1 1

and O -1 1
50 O -1 1
minute O -1 1
wait O -1 1
time, O -1 1
with O -1 1
an O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1

deliver O -1 1
below O -1 1
average O -1 1

It O -1 1
is O -1 1
kinda O -1 1
nosiy O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
tables O -1 1
are O -1 1
close O -1 1

but O -1 1
it's O -1 1
still O -1 1
a O -1 1
beautiful O -1 1

to O -1 1
enjoy O -1 1
a O -1 1

Besides O -1 1

we O -1 1
were O -1 1
served O -1 1

we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
ordered O -1 1

received O -1 1

minutes O -1 1
after O -1 1
the O -1 1

was O -1 1
undercooked), O -1 1
and O -1 1
charged O -1 1
$45 O -1 1

than O -1 1
we O -1 1
should O -1 1
have O -1 1

The O -1 1
overall O -1 1

very O -1 1
very O -1 1

Oh O -1 1

they O -1 1
lie O -1 1
on O -1 1

i O -1 1
can't O -1 1

their O -1 1

Oh O -1 1
yes, O -1 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
lie O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
phone, O -1 1
claiming O -1 1
they O -1 1
have O -1 1
seating B-ASP 1 1
in I-ASP 1 1
the I-ASP 1 1
garden, I-ASP 1 1
then O -1 1
of O -1 1
course O -1 1
the O -1 1

are O -1 1
not O -1 1

The O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
scatty O -1 1
at O -1 1
times O -1 1
but O -1 1
all O -1 1
is O -1 1
forgiven O -1 1
when O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
arrives. O -1 1

I O -1 1
had O -1 1
their O -1 1
eggs O -1 1
benedict O -1 1
for O -1 1
brunch, B-ASP 1 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
the O -1 1
worst O -1 1
in O -1 1
my O -1 1
entire O -1 1
life, O -1 1
I O -1 1
tried O -1 1
removing O -1 1
the O -1 1
hollondaise O -1 1
sauce O -1 1
completely O -1 1
that O -1 1
was O -1 1
how O -1 1
failed O -1 1
it O -1 1
was. O -1 1

Well, O -1 1
their O -1 1
deliveries O -1 1
take O -1 1
for O -1 1
ever O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
usually O -1 1
cold. O -1 1

The O -1 1
bruscetta O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
soggy, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
salads B-ASP 2 1
were O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1
included O -1 1
a O -1 1
nice O -1 1
mix O -1 1
of O -1 1
greens O -1 1
(not O -1 1
iceberg) O -1 1
all O -1 1

served O -1 1
piping O -1 1
hot O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1

My O -1 1
suggestion O -1 1
is O -1 1
to O -1 1
eat B-ASP 2 1
family I-ASP 2 1
style I-ASP 2 1
because O -1 1
you'll O -1 1
want O -1 1
to O -1 1
try O -1 1
the O -1 1
other O -1 1
dishes. O -1 1

The O -1 1
Dim B-ASP 1 1

was O -1 1
so-so, O -1 1

not O -1 1
spectacular. O -1 1

But O -1 1
that O -1 1
wasn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
icing B-ASP 0 1
on I-ASP 0 1
the I-ASP 0 1
cake: I-ASP 0 1
a O -1 1
tiramisu O -1 1
that O -1 1
resembled O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
I O -1 1
have O -1 1
ever O -1 1
had. O -1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
disappointment O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1

check I-ASP 0 1

who O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
seem O -1 1

the O -1 1

the O -1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1

is O -1 1
that O -1 1
the O -1 1

popularity, O -1 1
seems O -1 1
frantic. O -1 1

The O -1 1
restuarant O -1 1
itself O -1 1
is O -1 1
not O -1 1
large, O -1 1
but O -1 1
seems O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1
several O -1 1
round B-ASP 2 1
tables I-ASP 2 1
to O -1 1
accomodate O -1 1
large O -1 1
groups O -1 1
hoping O -1 1
to O -1 1
save O -1 1
a O -1 1
buck O -1 1
to O -1 1
eat O -1 1
authentic O -1 1
Taiwanese. O -1 1

My O -1 1
suggestion O -1 1
is O -1 1
to O -1 1
eat B-ASP 2 1
family I-ASP 2 1
style I-ASP 2 1
because O -1 1
you'll O -1 1
want O -1 1
to O -1 1
try O -1 1
the O -1 1
other O -1 1
dishes. O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu O -1 1
changed, O -1 1
portions O -1 1
were O -1 1
even O -1 1
smaller O -1 1
than O -1 1
before, O -1 1
a O -1 1
lentil O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
salty O -1 1
beyond O -1 1
edibility, O -1 1
a O -1 1
basmati B-ASP 0 1
rice I-ASP 0 1
dish I-ASP 0 1
lacked O -1 1
flavor. O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
noisy O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiters O -1 1
are O -1 1
literally O -1 1
walking O -1 1
around O -1 1
doing O -1 1
things O -1 1
as O -1 1
fast O -1 1
as O -1 1
they O -1 1
can. O -1 1

The O -1 1
Dim B-ASP 1 1
Sum I-ASP 1 1
was O -1 1
so-so, O -1 1
but O -1 1
not O -1 1
spectacular. O -1 1

And O -1 1
the O -1 1
Tom B-ASP 0 1
Kha I-ASP 0 1
soup I-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
pathetic. O -1 1

Here's O -1 1
to O -1 1
the O -1 1
fake O -1 1
fish B-ASP 0 1
tanks I-ASP 0 1
too... O -1 1

We O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
some O -1 1
beef B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
noodle O -1 1
soup O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
Thai O -1 1
section O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
menu O -1 1
but O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
was O -1 1
Thai. O -1 1

Try O -1 1
the O -1 1
chocolate B-ASP 2 1
mud I-ASP 2 1
cake I-ASP 2 1
(warmed) I-ASP 2 1
with O -1 1
2 O -1 1
scoops O -1 1
of O -1 1
dulce O -1 1
de O -1 1
leche O -1 1
gelato. O -1 1

Make O -1 1
reservations B-ASP 0 1
but O -1 1
expect O -1 1
to O -1 1
be O -1 1
delayed O -1 1
15-20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
as O -1 1
the O -1 1
hosting O -1 1
staff O -1 1
was O -1 1
having O -1 1
difficulty O -1 1
seating O -1 1
guests O -1 1
who O -1 1
arrived O -1 1
with O -1 1
a O -1 1
reservation O -1 1
because O -1 1
they O -1 1
probably O -1 1
had O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
of O -1 1
walk O -1 1
ins O -1 1
being O -1 1
so O -1 1
close O -1 1
to O -1 1
Time O -1 1
Square. O -1 1

The O -1 1
food B-ASP 2 1
is O -1 1
usually O -1 1
good O -1 1
but O -1 1
it O -1 1
certainly O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
a O -1 1
relaxing O -1 1
place O -1 1
to O -1 1
go. O -1 1

A O -1 1
cheap O -1 1
eat B-ASP 2 1
for O -1 1
NYC, O -1 1
but O -1 1
not O -1 1
for O -1 1

The O -1 1
Pad O -1 1
thai, O -1 1
lad O -1 1

and O -1 1
various O -1 1
other O -1 1
dishes B-ASP 3 1
all O -1 1
look O -1 1
good O -1 1
on O -1 1
paper O -1 1
but, O -1 1
I've O -1 1
had O -1 1
better O -1 1
thai O -1 1
food O -1 1
in O -1 1
less O -1 1
asthetically O -1 1
pleasing O -1 1
places. O -1 1

I O -1 1
was O -1 1
back-to-back O -1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1
diner B-ASP 1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
behind O -1 1
me O -1 1
and O -1 1
wait O -1 1

had O -1 1
to O -1 1
hoist O -1 1
trays O -1 1
over O -1 1
our O -1 1
heads O -1 1
as O -1 1
they O -1 1
squeezed O -1 1
past O -1 1
us O -1 1
again O -1 1
and O -1 1
again. O -1 1

The O -1 1
hostess O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress B-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
and O -1 1
did O -1 1
everything O -1 1
they O -1 1
could O -1 1
to O -1 1
rush O -1 1
us O -1 1
out. O -1 1

The O -1 1
hot B-ASP 0 1
dogs I-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
cold O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
middle O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
buns O -1 1
were O -1 1
stale. O -1 1

Wait O -1 1
staff O -1 1
is O -1 1
blantently O -1 1
unappreciative O -1 1
of O -1 1
your O -1 1

but O -1 1
its O -1 1
the O -1 1
best O -1 1
pie B-ASP 2 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
UWS! O -1 1

The O -1 1
food O -1 1
was O -1 1
very O -1 1
expensive O -1 1
(we O -1 1
spent O -1 1
$160 O -1 1
for O -1 1
lunch B-ASP 0 1
for O -1 1

but O -1 1
extremely O -1 1
tasty. O -1 1

I O -1 1
understand O -1 1
the O -1 1

The O -1 1

is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
too O -1 1
small O -1 1
for O -1 1
live O -1 1

so O -1 1
on O -1 1

it O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
loud O -1 1
and O -1 1

After O -1 1

needed O -1 1
the O -1 1

for O -1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1

was O -1 1
the O -1 1

only O -1 1
weird O -1 1

was O -1 1
if O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a(1) O -1 1

the O -1 1

the O -1 1

always O -1 1
someone O -1 1
to O -1 1
take O -1 1
that O -1 1
empty O -1 1

so O -1 1
it O -1 1
seems O -1 1
that O -1 1

service O -1 1
has O -1 1
been O -1 1
deemed O -1 1
not O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
essence. O -1 1

The O -1 1
rice O -1 1
was O -1 1
poor O -1 1
quality O -1 1

was O -1 1
cooked B-ASP 0 1

badly O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
hard. O -1 1

The O -1 1

it O -1 1

was O -1 1
the O -1 1
un-tasty O -1 1

it O -1 1
is O -1 1
slow O -1 1

But O -1 1
that O -1 1
wasn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
icing B-ASP 0 1
on I-ASP 0 1
the I-ASP 0 1

a O -1 1

nothing O -1 1

The O -1 1
bruscetta O -1 1

a O -1 1

the O -1 1

The O -1 1

all O -1 1
very O -1 1

it's O -1 1
not O -1 1

but O -1 1
I've O -1 1
never O -1 1
been O -1 1
dealt O -1 1

The O -1 1

the O -1 1

is O -1 1
also O -1 1
very O -1 1
limited O -1 1

this O -1 1

would O -1 1

definitely O -1 1

the O -1 1

off O -1 1

The O -1 1
food O -1 1
is O -1 1
usually O -1 1
good O -1 1

it O -1 1
certainly O -1 1

a O -1 1

a O -1 1

a O -1 1
basmati B-ASP 0 1

lacked O -1 1

Perhaps O -1 1
this O -1 1

is O -1 1
considered O -1 1
extreme O -1 1
to O -1 1
an O -1 1

the O -1 1

Probably O -1 1
much O -1 1

for O -1 1
lunch, B-ASP 1 1
it's O -1 1
seldom O -1 1

Any O -1 1
if O -1 1
you O -1 1

you'll O -1 1
wait O -1 1

the O -1 1

my O -1 1

large O -1 1

this O -1 1
was O -1 1
not O -1 1

i've O -1 1

the O -1 1

delicious O -1 1

very O -1 1

Go O -1 1

Volare O -1 1

terrific O -1 1

to O -1 1
deliver O -1 1
below O -1 1
average O -1 1
food. O -1 1

The O -1 1
space B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
too O -1 1
small O -1 1
for O -1 1
live O -1 1
music, O -1 1
so O -1 1
on O -1 1
jazz O -1 1
nights, O -1 1
it O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
loud O -1 1
and O -1 1
cramped. O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
like O -1 1
the O -1 1
one O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
website. O -1 1

We O -1 1
couldn't O -1 1
carry O -1 1
our O -1 1
conversation O -1 1
as O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
routinely O -1 1
interrupted O -1 1
by O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
and O -1 1
servants B-ASP 0 1
asking O -1 1
us O -1 1
to O -1 1
order O -1 1
and O -1 1
hinting O -1 1
that O -1 1
we're O -1 1
taking O -1 1
too O -1 1
much O -1 1
time O -1 1
-- O -1 1
amazing, O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
sat O -1 1
down. O -1 1

I O -1 1
am O -1 1
reluctant O -1 1
to O -1 1
write O -1 1
because O -1 1
I O -1 1
would O -1 1
not O -1 1
want O -1 1
my O -1 1
jem O -1 1
of O -1 1
a O -1 1
pizza B-ASP 2 1
place O -1 1
to O -1 1
become O -1 1
overcrowded. O -1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
weird O -1 1
thing O -1 1
was O -1 1
if O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a(1) O -1 1
bottle, O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
would O -1 1
have O -1 1
simply O -1 1
multiplied O -1 1
the O -1 1
glass O -1 1
price O -1 1
X4, O -1 1
which O -1 1
makes O -1 1
no O -1 1
sense O -1 1
whatsoever(2). O -1 1

We O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
a O -1 1
tuna O -1 1
melt O -1 1
- O -1 1
it O -1 1
came O -1 1
with O -1 1
out O -1 1
cheese B-ASP 1 1
which O -1 1
just O -1 1
made O -1 1
it O -1 1
a O -1 1
tuna O -1 1
sandwich. O -1 1

The O -1 1
food O -1 1
was O -1 1
not O -1 1
very O -1 1
tasty, O -1 1
the O -1 1
portioins B-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
tiny O -1 1
even O -1 1
for O -1 1
such O -1 1
a O -1 1
high O -1 1
quality O -1 1
restaurant. O -1 1

Perhaps O -1 1
this O -1 1
food O -1 1
is O -1 1
considered O -1 1
extreme O -1 1
to O -1 1
an O -1 1
Upper O -1 1
East O -1 1
Side O -1 1
resident, O -1 1
but O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
rest O -1 1
of O -1 1
us O -1 1
who've O -1 1
actually O -1 1
eaten O -1 1
ethnic B-ASP 0 1
food, I-ASP 0 1
this O -1 1
is O -1 1
simply O -1 1
dull. O -1 1

The O -1 1
worst O -1 1
though O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
taste. B-ASP 0 1

Even O -1 1
though O -1 1
its O -1 1
good O -1 1
seafood, B-ASP 2 1
the O -1 1
prices O -1 1
are O -1 1
too O -1 1
high. O -1 1

but O -1 1
when O -1 1
we O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
menu, O -1 1
there O -1 1
weren't O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
of O -1 1
choices, O -1 1
most O -1 1
of O -1 1
them O -1 1
were O -1 1
dumplings O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
appetizer B-ASP 0 1
section. O -1 1

Went O -1 1
there O -1 1
with O -1 1
my O -1 1
wife O -1 1
and O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
table O -1 1
even O -1 1
though O -1 1
you O -1 1
could O -1 1
see O -1 1
there O -1 1
many O -1 1
that O -1 1
were O -1 1
empty O -1 1
with O -1 1
not O -1 1
reservation B-ASP 1 1
sigh I-ASP 1 1
on O -1 1
them. O -1 1

i O -1 1
don't O -1 1
usually O -1 1
order O -1 1
wine O -1 1
with O -1 1
indian B-ASP 1 1
so O -1 1
i O -1 1
can't O -1 1
comment O -1 1
on O -1 1
their O -1 1
wine O -1 1
list O -1 1
or O -1 1
their O -1 1
wines. O -1 1

While O -1 1
the O -1 1
ambiance O -1 1
and O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
were O -1 1
great, O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
and O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
could O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
better. O -1 1

Knowledge O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
chef B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
are O -1 1
below O -1 1
average. O -1 1

Everything, O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
soft O -1 1
bread, B-ASP 0 1
soggy O -1 1
salad, O -1 1
and O -1 1
50 O -1 1
minute O -1 1
wait O -1 1
time, O -1 1
with O -1 1
an O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
service O -1 1
to O -1 1
deliver O -1 1
below O -1 1
average O -1 1
food. O -1 1

However, O -1 1
I O -1 1
was O -1 1
there O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
work O -1 1
dinner B-ASP 1 1
not O -1 1
long O -1 1
ago O -1 1
when O -1 1
my O -1 1
colleague O -1 1
from O -1 1
London O -1 1
noticed O -1 1
a O -1 1
very O -1 1
large O -1 1
waterbug O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
ceiling. O -1 1

Still, O -1 1
any O -1 1
quibbles O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
bill B-ASP 3 1
were O -1 1
off-set O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
pour-your-own O -1 1
measures O -1 1
of O -1 1
liquers O -1 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
courtesey O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
house... O -1 1

The O -1 1
bruscetta O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
soggy, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
salads O -1 1
were O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1
included O -1 1
a O -1 1
nice O -1 1
mix O -1 1
of O -1 1
greens O -1 1
(not O -1 1
iceberg) B-ASP 1 1
all O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
are O -1 1
served O -1 1
piping O -1 1
hot O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
kitchen. O -1 1

They O -1 1
forgot O -1 1
a O -1 1
sandwich, O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
plastic O -1 1
forks, O -1 1
and O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
pita B-ASP 1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1
hummus O -1 1
platter. O -1 1

I O -1 1
went O -1 1
there O -1 1
in O -1 1
late O -1 1
afternoon O -1 1
for O -1 1
some O -1 1
bite O -1 1
size O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
and O -1 1
refleshment O -1 1
with O -1 1
my O -1 1
date. O -1 1

The O -1 1
Italian B-ASP 2 1
food I-ASP 2 1
has O -1 1
flavor O -1 1
(that O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
sort O -1 1
of O -1 1
surprising O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
UES), O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
service O -1 1
turns O -1 1
from O -1 1
a O -1 1
nightmare O -1 1
to O -1 1
attentive,they O -1 1
sort O -1 1
of O -1 1
remind O -1 1
me O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
NY O -1 1
Yankees O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
late O -1 1
90's, O -1 1
no O -1 1
matter O -1 1
how O -1 1
bad O -1 1
it O -1 1
look, O -1 1
you O -1 1
knew O -1 1
that O -1 1
there O -1 1
was O -1 1
a O -1 1
rally O -1 1
just O -1 1
around O -1 1
the O -1 1
corner... O -1 1

My O -1 1
biggest O -1 1
complaint O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
un-tasty O -1 1
food B-ASP 3 1
although O -1 1
presented O -1 1
well. O -1 1

Don't O -1 1
go O -1 1
alone---even O -1 1
two O -1 1
people O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
enough O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
whole O -1 1
experience, O -1 1
with O -1 1
pickles B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
a O -1 1
selection O -1 1
of O -1 1
meats O -1 1
and O -1 1
seafoods. O -1 1

The O -1 1
octopus O -1 1
eaters O -1 1
were O -1 1
floored O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
Octopus B-ASP 2 1
salad. I-ASP 2 1

Service B-ASP 0 1
could O -1 1
be O -1 1
improved O -1 1
but O -1 1
overall O -1 1
this O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
place O -1 1
that O -1 1
understands O -1 1
the O -1 1
importance O -1 1
of O -1 1
little O -1 1
things O -1 1
(the O -1 1
heavy, O -1 1
black, O -1 1
antique-seeming O -1 1
teapot, O -1 1
for O -1 1
one) O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
experience. O -1 1

We O -1 1
got O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
tipsy O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
sake B-ASP 1 1
but O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
that O -1 1
what O -1 1
Saturday O -1 1
nights O -1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1
girlfriends O -1 1
are O -1 1
all O -1 1
about? O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu O -1 1
changed, O -1 1
portions O -1 1
were O -1 1
even O -1 1
smaller O -1 1
than O -1 1
before, O -1 1
a O -1 1
lentil O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
salty O -1 1
beyond O -1 1
edibility, O -1 1
a O -1 1
basmati O -1 1
rice O -1 1
dish O -1 1
lacked O -1 1
flavor. B-ASP 0 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
problem O -1 1
is O -1 1
that O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
complete O -1 1
incompetent. O -1 1

I O -1 1
understand O -1 1
the O -1 1
area O -1 1
and O -1 1
folks O -1 1
you O -1 1
need O -1 1
not O -1 1
come O -1 1
here O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1

and O -1 1
back O -1 1

you O -1 1
come O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
authentic O -1 1
foods, O -1 1
the O -1 1
tastes, O -1 1
the O -1 1
experiance. O -1 1

The O -1 1
large O -1 1
selection O -1 1
of O -1 1
bruschettas, O -1 1
paninis, O -1 1
tramezzinis B-ASP 2 1
keep O -1 1
the O -1 1
palate O -1 1
from O -1 1
stagnating. O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
like O -1 1
the O -1 1
one O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
website. O -1 1

I O -1 1
have O -1 1
never O -1 1
had O -1 1
cheescake B-ASP 2 1
like O -1 1
this. O -1 1

It O -1 1
is O -1 1
kinda O -1 1
nosiy O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
tables O -1 1
are O -1 1
close O -1 1
together O -1 1

it's O -1 1
still O -1 1
a O -1 1
beautiful O -1 1

uneventful, O -1 1

The O -1 1
crispy B-ASP 0 1
chicken I-ASP 0 1
wasn't O -1 1
for O -1 1
us, O -1 1
though. O -1 1

If O -1 1
it's O -1 1
just O -1 1
a O -1 1
quick O -1 1
martini B-ASP 1 1
at O -1 1

The O -1 1

is O -1 1
ok O -1 1
but O -1 1
doesn't O -1 1
taste O -1 1
that O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1

don't O -1 1

they O -1 1
should O -1 1
(also O -1 1
note O -1 1
lack O -1 1
of O -1 1

here). O -1 1

Try O -1 1
the O -1 1
olive O -1 1

or O -1 1
the O -1 1

and I-ASP 0 1
chow B-ASP 0 1
see I-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
really O -1 1
bland O -1 1
and O -1 1
oily. O -1 1

We O -1 1
actually O -1 1
gave O -1 1
10% O -1 1
tip O -1 1
(which O -1 1
we O -1 1
have O -1 1

because O -1 1
we O -1 1
felt O -1 1
totally O -1 1
ripped O -1 1
off. O -1 1

The O -1 1

a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
too O -1 1
small O -1 1
for O -1 1

so O -1 1
on O -1 1

were O -1 1
busy. O -1 1

If O -1 1
you're O -1 1
craving O -1 1
for O -1 1
Haru's O -1 1
great O -1 1
food, B-ASP 2 1
especially O -1 1
the O -1 1
House O -1 1
Roll, O -1 1
but O -1 1
can't O -1 1
stand O -1 1
the O -1 1

head O -1 1
across O -1 1
the O -1 1

their O -1 1
Sake O -1 1
Bar! O -1 1

The O -1 1
overall O -1 1
price B-ASP 0 1
tag I-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
very O -1 1
very O -1 1
expensive, O -1 1
something O -1 1
I O -1 1
did O -1 1
expect. O -1 1

Good O -1 1
French O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
in O -1 1
an O -1 1
area O -1 1
devoid O -1 1
of O -1 1
decent O -1 1
restaurants O -1 1
unless O -1 1
you're O -1 1
into O -1 1
eating O -1 1
4 O -1 1
pound O -1 1
pastrami B-ASP 1 1
sandwiches I-ASP 1 1
at O -1 1
Katz' O -1 1
Deli, O -1 1
or O -1 1
Mexican O -1 1
food O -1 1
which O -1 1
is O -1 1
supplied O -1 1
by O -1 1
capable O -1 1
restaurants. O -1 1

The O -1 1
rice O -1 1
was O -1 1
poor O -1 1
quality O -1 1
and O -1 1
was O -1 1
cooked B-ASP 0 1
so O -1 1
badly O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
hard. O -1 1

There O -1 1
is O -1 1
no O -1 1
excuse O -1 1
for O -1 1
such O -1 1
lousy O -1 1
service! B-ASP 0 1

Late O -1 1
nite O -1 1
omelletes B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
not O -1 1
good O -1 1
here, O -1 1
there O -1 1
is O -1 1
no O -1 1
variety! O -1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
weird O -1 1
thing O -1 1
was O -1 1
if O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a(1) O -1 1
bottle, O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
would O -1 1
have O -1 1
simply O -1 1
multiplied O -1 1
the O -1 1
glass O -1 1
price O -1 1
X4, O -1 1
which O -1 1
makes O -1 1
no O -1 1
sense O -1 1
whatsoever(2). O -1 1

Great O -1 1
food O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
dreadful! O -1 1

We O -1 1
couldn't O -1 1
carry O -1 1
our O -1 1
conversation O -1 1
as O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
routinely O -1 1
interrupted O -1 1
by O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
and O -1 1
servants B-ASP 0 1
asking O -1 1
us O -1 1
to O -1 1
order O -1 1
and O -1 1
hinting O -1 1
that O -1 1
we're O -1 1
taking O -1 1
too O -1 1
much O -1 1
time O -1 1
-- O -1 1
amazing, O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
sat O -1 1
down. O -1 1

but O -1 1
when O -1 1
we O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
menu, O -1 1
there O -1 1
weren't O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
of O -1 1
choices, O -1 1
most O -1 1
of O -1 1
them O -1 1
were O -1 1
dumplings B-ASP 1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
appetizer O -1 1
section. O -1 1

The O -1 1
service O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
scatty O -1 1
at O -1 1
times O -1 1
but O -1 1
all O -1 1
is O -1 1
forgiven O -1 1
when O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 2 1
arrives. O -1 1

The O -1 1
bruscetta O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
soggy, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
salads O -1 1
were O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1
included O -1 1
a O -1 1
nice O -1 1
mix B-ASP 2 1
of I-ASP 2 1
greens I-ASP 2 1
(not O -1 1
iceberg) O -1 1
all O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
are O -1 1
served O -1 1
piping O -1 1
hot O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
kitchen. O -1 1

would O -1 1
have O -1 1
rather O -1 1
tried O -1 1
terrace O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
sky O -1 1
or O -1 1
water O -1 1
club O -1 1
for O -1 1
that O -1 1
price B-ASP 0 1

A O -1 1
cheap O -1 1
eat B-ASP 2 1
for O -1 1
NYC, O -1 1
but O -1 1
not O -1 1
for O -1 1
dosa. O -1 1

But O -1 1
they O -1 1
don't O -1 1
have O -1 1
a O -1 1
toaster, B-ASP 0 1
which O -1 1
is O -1 1
strange. O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu B-ASP 0 1
changed, O -1 1
portions O -1 1
were O -1 1
even O -1 1
smaller O -1 1
than O -1 1
before, O -1 1
a O -1 1
lentil O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
salty O -1 1
beyond O -1 1
edibility, O -1 1
a O -1 1
basmati O -1 1
rice O -1 1
dish O -1 1
lacked O -1 1
flavor. O -1 1

Only O -1 1
complaint O -1 1
would O -1 1
be O -1 1
that O -1 1
at O -1 1
an O -1 1
average O -1 1
cost O -1 1
of O -1 1
$12-$15 O -1 1
per O -1 1
meal, B-ASP 1 1
I'd O -1 1
like O -1 1
not O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
worry O -1 1
about O -1 1
finding O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat! O -1 1

One O -1 1
would O -1 1
think O -1 1
we'd O -1 1
get O -1 1
an O -1 1
apology O -1 1
or O -1 1
complimentary O -1 1
drinks B-ASP 1 1
- B-ASP 1 1
instead, O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a O -1 1
snobby O -1 1
waiter O -1 1
wouldn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
take O -1 1
our O -1 1
order O -1 1
for O -1 1
15 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
and O -1 1
gave O -1 1
us O -1 1
lip O -1 1
when O -1 1
we O -1 1
asked O -1 1
him O -1 1
to O -1 1
do O -1 1
so. O -1 1

Went O -1 1
there O -1 1
with O -1 1
my O -1 1
wife O -1 1
and O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
table O -1 1
even O -1 1
though O -1 1
you O -1 1
could O -1 1
see O -1 1
there O -1 1
many O -1 1
that O -1 1
were O -1 1
empty O -1 1
with O -1 1
not O -1 1
reservation B-ASP 1 1
sigh I-ASP 1 1
on O -1 1
them. O -1 1

I O -1 1
had O -1 1
their O -1 1
eggs O -1 1
benedict O -1 1
for O -1 1
brunch, B-ASP 1 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
the O -1 1
worst O -1 1
in O -1 1
my O -1 1
entire O -1 1
life, O -1 1
I O -1 1
tried O -1 1
removing O -1 1
the O -1 1
hollondaise O -1 1
sauce O -1 1
completely O -1 1
that O -1 1
was O -1 1
how O -1 1
failed O -1 1
it O -1 1
was. O -1 1

The O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
awful--the O -1 1
last O -1 1
time O -1 1
I O -1 1
was O -1 1
there O -1 1
(and O -1 1
I O -1 1
do O -1 1
mean O -1 1
the O -1 1
last O -1 1
time) O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
told O -1 1
that O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
our O -1 1
table O -1 1
so O -1 1
we O -1 1
would O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
leave. O -1 1

If O -1 1
it's O -1 1
just O -1 1
a O -1 1
quick O -1 1
martini B-ASP 1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
bar O -1 1
(which O -1 1
I O -1 1
recommend O -1 1
Jeffery's) O -1 1
or O -1 1
a O -1 1
mind O -1 1
blowing O -1 1
Roast O -1 1
Chicken, O -1 1
go O -1 1
to O -1 1
Village! O -1 1

The O -1 1
food O -1 1
was O -1 1
not O -1 1
very O -1 1
tasty, O -1 1
the O -1 1
portioins B-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
tiny O -1 1
even O -1 1
for O -1 1
such O -1 1
a O -1 1
high O -1 1
quality O -1 1
restaurant. O -1 1

With O -1 1
the O -1 1
exception O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
lemon B-ASP 0 1
salad I-ASP 0 1
that O -1 1
had O -1 1
so O -1 1
much O -1 1
pepper O -1 1
on O -1 1
it O -1 1
that O -1 1
our O -1 1
eyes O -1 1
started O -1 1
watering, O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
here O -1 1
was O -1 1
decent, O -1 1
not O -1 1
great. O -1 1

We O -1 1
had O -1 1
reservations B-ASP 0 1
at O -1 1
9pm, O -1 1
but O -1 1
was O -1 1
not O -1 1
seated O -1 1
until O -1 1
10:15pm. O -1 1

Any O -1 1
if O -1 1
you O -1 1
have O -1 1
a O -1 1
reservation O -1 1
you'll O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
max O -1 1
5 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
- O -1 1
so O -1 1
have O -1 1
a O -1 1
drink B-ASP 1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
bar. O -1 1

If O -1 1
I O -1 1
could O -1 1
rate O -1 1
the O -1 1
people B-ASP 2 1
this O -1 1
place O -1 1
would O -1 1
be O -1 1
off O -1 1
the O -1 1
charts O -1 1
- O -1 1
unfortunately O -1 1
- O -1 1
the O -1 1
pizza, O -1 1
sorry O -1 1
- O -1 1
not O -1 1
the O -1 1
best O -1 1
in O -1 1
NYC. O -1 1

I O -1 1
had O -1 1
their O -1 1
eggs O -1 1
benedict O -1 1
for O -1 1
brunch, B-ASP 1 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1

how O -1 1
failed O -1 1
it O -1 1
was. O -1 1

Everything, O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
soft O -1 1
bread, O -1 1
soggy O -1 1
salad, O -1 1
and O -1 1
50 O -1 1
minute O -1 1

with O -1 1
an O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
to O -1 1
deliver O -1 1
below O -1 1
average O -1 1
food. O -1 1

The O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
was O -1 1
mediocre O -1 1
at O -1 1
best O -1 1
but O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
horrible O -1 1
service O -1 1
that O -1 1
made O -1 1
me O -1 1
vow O -1 1
never O -1 1
to O -1 1
go O -1 1
back. O -1 1

A O -1 1
cheap O -1 1
eat O -1 1
for O -1 1
NYC, O -1 1
but O -1 1
not O -1 1
for O -1 1
dosa. B-ASP 0 1

The O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
absolutely O -1 1
horrible! O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
greatest O -1 1
, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I O -1 1
suppose O -1 1
that's O -1 1
how O -1 1
they O -1 1
keep O -1 1
the O -1 1
prices B-ASP 2 1
down O -1 1
. O -1 1

After O -1 1
2 O -1 1
tries O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiter B-ASP 0 1
to O -1 1
take O -1 1
it O -1 1
away O -1 1
(we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
it O -1 1
yet, O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
full O -1 1
beers O -1 1
yet O -1 1
to O -1 1
drink), O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager O -1 1
approached O -1 1
and O -1 1
told O -1 1
us O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
for O -1 1
people O -1 1
with O -1 1
reservations. O -1 1

You O -1 1
rarely O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
currys O -1 1
(masaman, O -1 1
green, O -1 1
red) O -1 1
are O -1 1
full O -1 1
of O -1 1
flavor O -1 1
and O -1 1
come O -1 1
super O -1 1
spicy O -1 1
if O -1 1
you O -1 1
ask O -1 1
for O -1 1
it. O -1 1

This O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
your O -1 1
corner O -1 1
Chinese B-ASP 1 1
food I-ASP 1 1
takeout. O -1 1

This O -1 1
place, O -1 1
however, O -1 1
has O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
less O -1 1
pretension O -1 1
than O -1 1
Joya O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
Thai B-ASP 2 1
food I-ASP 2 1
is O -1 1
still O -1 1
above-average. O -1 1

While O -1 1
certain O -1 1
staples O -1 1
are O -1 1
excellent O -1 1
(the O -1 1
burger, O -1 1
some O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
pastas), O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
is O -1 1
not O -1 1
really O -1 1
the O -1 1
point. O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere B-ASP 1 1
isn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
greatest O -1 1
, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I O -1 1
suppose O -1 1
that's O -1 1
how O -1 1
they O -1 1
keep O -1 1
the O -1 1
prices O -1 1
down O -1 1
. O -1 1

However, O -1 1
I O -1 1
was O -1 1
there O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
work O -1 1
dinner B-ASP 1 1
not O -1 1
long O -1 1
ago O -1 1
when O -1 1
my O -1 1
colleague O -1 1
from O -1 1
London O -1 1
noticed O -1 1
a O -1 1
very O -1 1
large O -1 1
waterbug O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
ceiling. O -1 1

I O -1 1
couldn't O -1 1
reccommend O -1 1
their O -1 1
Godmother B-ASP 2 1
pizza I-ASP 2 1
any O -1 1
higher. O -1 1

The O -1 1
portions O -1 1
are O -1 1
HUGE, O -1 1
so O -1 1
it O -1 1
might O -1 1
be O -1 1
good O -1 1
to O -1 1
order O -1 1
three O -1 1
things O -1 1
to O -1 1
split O -1 1
(rather O -1 1
than O -1 1

entree O -1 1
per O -1 1
person) O -1 1
for O -1 1

some O -1 1

from O -1 1
the O -1 1

nothing O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
was O -1 1
Thai. O -1 1

I O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
the O -1 1
smoked B-ASP 0 1
salmon I-ASP 0 1
and I-ASP 0 1
roe I-ASP 0 1
appetizer I-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
off O -1 1
flavor. O -1 1

He O -1 1
offers O -1 1
subpar O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
has O -1 1
no O -1 1
personality. O -1 1

Only O -1 1
complaint O -1 1
would O -1 1
be O -1 1
that O -1 1
at O -1 1
an O -1 1
average O -1 1
cost O -1 1
of O -1 1
$12-$15 O -1 1
per O -1 1
meal, O -1 1
I'd O -1 1
like O -1 1
not O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
worry O -1 1
about O -1 1
finding O -1 1

snobby O -1 1
waiter B-ASP 0 1
wouldn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
take O -1 1
our O -1 1
order O -1 1
for O -1 1
15 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
and O -1 1
gave O -1 1
us O -1 1
lip O -1 1
when O -1 1
we O -1 1
asked O -1 1
him O -1 1
to O -1 1
do O -1 1
so. O -1 1

Besides O -1 1
having O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
been O -1 1
promised O -1 1
given O -1 1
to O -1 1
other O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
patrons O -1 1
twice O -1 1
before O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
actually O -1 1
seated, O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
served O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
three O -1 1
times, O -1 1
received O -1 1
one O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
orders O -1 1
20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
after O -1 1
the O -1 1
rest O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
table B-ASP 0 1
had O -1 1
been O -1 1
served O -1 1
(and O -1 1
that O -1 1
order O -1 1
was O -1 1
undercooked), O -1 1
and O -1 1
charged O -1 1
$45 O -1 1
more O -1 1
than O -1 1
we O -1 1
should O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
on O -1 1
our O -1 1
bill. O -1 1

The O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
was O -1 1
packed O -1 1
at O -1 1
first, O -1 1
so O -1 1
we O -1 1
waited O -1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
bar B-ASP 1 1
for O -1 1
about O -1 1
20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
before O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
seated. O -1 1

We O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
some O -1 1
beef O -1 1
and O -1 1
noodle B-ASP 0 1
soup I-ASP 0 1
dishes I-ASP 0 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
Thai O -1 1
section O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
menu O -1 1
but O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
was O -1 1
Thai. O -1 1

Bartender B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
unable O -1 1
to O -1 1
tear O -1 1
himself O -1 1
away O -1 1
from O -1 1
friends O -1 1
at O -1 1
bar. O -1 1

The O -1 1
rice O -1 1
was O -1 1
poor O -1 1
quality B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
was O -1 1
cooked O -1 1
so O -1 1
badly O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
hard. O -1 1

With O -1 1
the O -1 1
exception O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
lemon O -1 1
salad O -1 1
that O -1 1
had O -1 1
so O -1 1
much O -1 1
pepper O -1 1
on O -1 1
it O -1 1
that O -1 1
our O -1 1
eyes O -1 1
started O -1 1
watering, O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
here O -1 1
was O -1 1
decent, O -1 1
not O -1 1
great. O -1 1

I O -1 1
was O -1 1
in O -1 1
love O -1 1
with O -1 1
Pongsri O -1 1
on O -1 1
48th, O -1 1
but O -1 1
compared O -1 1
to O -1 1
Suan O -1 1
it O -1 1
is O -1 1
slow O -1 1
in O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
overpriced. O -1 1

Even O -1 1
though O -1 1
its O -1 1
good O -1 1
seafood, O -1 1
the O -1 1
prices B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
too O -1 1
high. O -1 1

With O -1 1
the O -1 1
exception O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
lemon O -1 1
salad O -1 1
that O -1 1
had O -1 1
so O -1 1
much O -1 1
pepper B-ASP 0 1

our O -1 1
eyes O -1 1
started O -1 1

the O -1 1
food O -1 1
here O -1 1
was O -1 1
decent, O -1 1
not O -1 1
great. O -1 1

I O -1 1
wouldn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
have O -1 1
complained O -1 1
at O -1 1
all O -1 1
if O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
at O -1 1
least O -1 1
tasted O -1 1
good O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
quality B-ASP 0 1
of I-ASP 0 1
food I-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
crappy, O -1 1
too. O -1 1

After O -1 1
2 O -1 1
tries O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiter O -1 1
to O -1 1
take O -1 1
it O -1 1
away O -1 1
(we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
it O -1 1
yet, O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
full O -1 1
beers B-ASP 1 1
yet O -1 1
to O -1 1
drink), O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager O -1 1
approached O -1 1
and O -1 1
told O -1 1
us O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
for O -1 1
people O -1 1
with O -1 1
reservations. O -1 1

The O -1 1
pizza B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
delivered O -1 1
cold O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
cheese O -1 1
wasn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
fully O -1 1
melted! O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu O -1 1
changed, O -1 1
portions B-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
even O -1 1
smaller O -1 1
than O -1 1
before, O -1 1
a O -1 1
lentil O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
salty O -1 1
beyond O -1 1
edibility, O -1 1
a O -1 1
basmati O -1 1
rice O -1 1
dish O -1 1
lacked O -1 1
flavor. O -1 1

You O -1 1
rarely O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
currys O -1 1
(masaman, O -1 1
green, O -1 1
red) O -1 1
are O -1 1
full O -1 1
of O -1 1
flavor B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
come O -1 1
super O -1 1
spicy O -1 1
if O -1 1
you O -1 1
ask O -1 1
for O -1 1
it. O -1 1

It O -1 1
is O -1 1
kinda O -1 1
nosiy O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
tables O -1 1
are O -1 1
close O -1 1
together O -1 1
but O -1 1
it's O -1 1
still O -1 1
a O -1 1
beautiful O -1 1
place O -1 1
to O -1 1
enjoy O -1 1
a O -1 1
nice O -1 1
dinner. B-ASP 2 1

They O -1 1
smell O -1 1
like O -1 1
they O -1 1
stuff O -1 1
them O -1 1
with O -1 1
old O -1 1
canned O -1 1
vegetables O -1 1
like O -1 1
the O -1 1
spinach B-ASP 0 1
mushroom I-ASP 0 1
calzone. I-ASP 0 1

I O -1 1
was O -1 1
back-to-back O -1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1
diner B-ASP 1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
behind O -1 1
me O -1 1
and O -1 1
wait O -1 1
staff O -1 1
had O -1 1
to O -1 1
hoist O -1 1
trays O -1 1
over O -1 1
our O -1 1
heads O -1 1
as O -1 1
they O -1 1
squeezed O -1 1
past O -1 1
us O -1 1
again O -1 1
and O -1 1
again. O -1 1

One O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
earlier O -1 1
people O -1 1
commenting O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
did O -1 1
not O -1 1
get O -1 1
the O -1 1
that O -1 1
some O -1 1
experimenting O -1 1
is O -1 1
going O -1 1
on O -1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1
menu B-ASP 2 1
in O -1 1
a O -1 1
positive O -1 1
way. O -1 1

They O -1 1
forgot O -1 1
a O -1 1
sandwich, B-ASP 1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
plastic O -1 1
forks, O -1 1
and O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
pita O -1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1
hummus O -1 1
platter. O -1 1

We O -1 1
actually O -1 1
gave O -1 1
10% O -1 1
tip B-ASP 0 1
(which O -1 1
we O -1 1
have O -1 1
never O -1 1
done O -1 1
despite O -1 1
mediocre O -1 1
food O -1 1
and O -1 1
service), O -1 1
because O -1 1
we O -1 1
felt O -1 1
totally O -1 1
ripped O -1 1
off. O -1 1

All O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
pizzas B-ASP 2 1
are O -1 1
terrific O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
price O -1 1
is O -1 1
even O -1 1
better! O -1 1

They O -1 1
charge O -1 1
different O -1 1
prices B-ASP 0 1
all O -1 1
the O -1 1
time. O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu O -1 1
changed, O -1 1
portions O -1 1
were O -1 1
even O -1 1
smaller O -1 1
than O -1 1
before, O -1 1
a O -1 1
lentil O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
salty O -1 1
beyond O -1 1
edibility, O -1 1
a O -1 1
basmati O -1 1
rice O -1 1
dish O -1 1
lacked O -1 1
flavor. B-ASP 0 1

The O -1 1
rice O -1 1
was O -1 1
poor O -1 1
quality O -1 1
and O -1 1
was O -1 1
cooked B-ASP 0 1
so O -1 1
badly O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
hard. O -1 1

The O -1 1
food O -1 1
was O -1 1
mediocre O -1 1
at O -1 1
best O -1 1
but O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
horrible O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
that O -1 1
made O -1 1
me O -1 1
vow O -1 1
never O -1 1
to O -1 1
go O -1 1
back. O -1 1

This O -1 1
place, B-ASP 2 1
however, O -1 1
has O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
less O -1 1
pretension O -1 1
than O -1 1
Joya O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
Thai O -1 1
food O -1 1
is O -1 1
still O -1 1
above-average. O -1 1

The O -1 1
hot B-ASP 0 1
dogs I-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
cold O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
middle O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
buns O -1 1
were O -1 1
stale. O -1 1

Oh O -1 1
yes, O -1 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
lie O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
phone, O -1 1
claiming O -1 1
they O -1 1
have O -1 1
seating B-ASP 1 1
in I-ASP 1 1
the I-ASP 1 1
garden, I-ASP 1 1
then O -1 1
of O -1 1
course O -1 1
the O -1 1
seats O -1 1
are O -1 1
not O -1 1
available. O -1 1

Still, O -1 1
any O -1 1
quibbles O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
bill B-ASP 3 1
were O -1 1
off-set O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
pour-your-own O -1 1
measures O -1 1
of O -1 1
liquers O -1 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
courtesey O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
house... O -1 1

A O -1 1
cheap O -1 1
eat O -1 1
for O -1 1
NYC, O -1 1
but O -1 1
not O -1 1
for O -1 1
dosa. B-ASP 0 1

The O -1 1
service O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
scatty O -1 1
at O -1 1
times O -1 1
but O -1 1
all O -1 1
is O -1 1
forgiven O -1 1
when O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 2 1
arrives. O -1 1

The O -1 1
Pad O -1 1
thai, O -1 1
lad O -1 1
nar O -1 1
and O -1 1
various O -1 1
other O -1 1
dishes B-ASP 3 1
all O -1 1
look O -1 1
good O -1 1
on O -1 1
paper O -1 1
but, O -1 1
I've O -1 1
had O -1 1
better O -1 1
thai O -1 1
food O -1 1
in O -1 1
less O -1 1
asthetically O -1 1
pleasing O -1 1
places. O -1 1

After O -1 1
complaining O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
chicken B-ASP 0 1
dish, I-ASP 0 1
the O -1 1
manager O -1 1
came O -1 1
over O -1 1
to O -1 1
tell O -1 1
us O -1 1
that, O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
had O -1 1
ever O -1 1
complained O -1 1
before, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
know O -1 1
what O -1 1
the O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
supposed O -1 1
to O -1 1
taste O -1 1
like. O -1 1

The O -1 1
waitstaff B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
all O -1 1
very O -1 1
busy, O -1 1
it's O -1 1
not O -1 1
outstanding O -1 1
service, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I've O -1 1
never O -1 1
been O -1 1
dealt O -1 1
with O -1 1
rudely. O -1 1

We O -1 1
actually O -1 1
gave O -1 1
10% O -1 1
tip B-ASP 0 1
(which O -1 1
we O -1 1
have O -1 1
never O -1 1
done O -1 1
despite O -1 1
mediocre O -1 1
food O -1 1
and O -1 1
service), O -1 1
because O -1 1
we O -1 1
felt O -1 1
totally O -1 1
ripped O -1 1
off. O -1 1

What O -1 1
I O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
like O -1 1
was O -1 1
how O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
came O -1 1
right O -1 1
after O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
ordered. O -1 1

We O -1 1
had O -1 1
reservations B-ASP 0 1
at O -1 1
9pm, O -1 1
but O -1 1
was O -1 1
not O -1 1
seated O -1 1
until O -1 1
10:15pm. O -1 1

If O -1 1
it's O -1 1
just O -1 1
a O -1 1
quick O -1 1
martini O -1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
bar B-ASP 1 1

I O -1 1

Roast O -1 1
Chicken, O -1 1
go O -1 1
to O -1 1
Village! O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
noisy O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiters O -1 1
are O -1 1
literally O -1 1
walking O -1 1
around O -1 1
doing O -1 1
things O -1 1
as O -1 1
fast O -1 1
as O -1 1
they O -1 1
can. O -1 1

I O -1 1
had O -1 1
their O -1 1
eggs B-ASP 0 1
benedict I-ASP 0 1
for O -1 1
brunch, O -1 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
the O -1 1
worst O -1 1
in O -1 1
my O -1 1
entire O -1 1
life, O -1 1
I O -1 1
tried O -1 1
removing O -1 1
the O -1 1
hollondaise O -1 1
sauce O -1 1
completely O -1 1
that O -1 1
was O -1 1
how O -1 1
failed O -1 1
it O -1 1
was. O -1 1

Oh O -1 1
yes, O -1 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
lie O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
phone, O -1 1
claiming O -1 1
they O -1 1
have O -1 1
seating B-ASP 1 1
in I-ASP 1 1
the I-ASP 1 1

then O -1 1
of O -1 1
course O -1 1
the O -1 1

are O -1 1
not O -1 1

After O -1 1
2 O -1 1
tries O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiter O -1 1
to O -1 1
take O -1 1
it O -1 1
away O -1 1
(we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
looked O -1 1

yet, O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
full O -1 1

the O -1 1
manager O -1 1
approached O -1 1

told O -1 1
us O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1

If O -1 1

The O -1 1
food O -1 1
is O -1 1
usually O -1 1
good O -1 1

it O -1 1
certainly O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
a O -1 1

The O -1 1

in O -1 1
my O -1 1

removing O -1 1
the O -1 1
hollondaise O -1 1

completely O -1 1
that O -1 1
was O -1 1
how O -1 1
failed O -1 1
it O -1 1
was. O -1 1

After O -1 1
2 O -1 1
tries O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiter O -1 1
to O -1 1
take O -1 1
it O -1 1
away O -1 1
(we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1

yet, O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
full O -1 1
beers B-ASP 1 1

to O -1 1
drink), O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager O -1 1
approached O -1 1
and O -1 1
told O -1 1
us O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
for O -1 1
people O -1 1

Well, O -1 1
their O -1 1

for O -1 1

and O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
usually O -1 1
cold. O -1 1

The O -1 1
dim O -1 1

is O -1 1
ok O -1 1
but O -1 1
doesn't O -1 1
taste O -1 1
that O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
little B-ASP 0 1

don't O -1 1
look O -1 1
steamy O -1 1
hot O -1 1

they O -1 1
should O -1 1
(also O -1 1
note O -1 1
lack O -1 1
of O -1 1

Everything, O -1 1

the O -1 1

that's O -1 1
not O -1 1

While O -1 1
the O -1 1

The O -1 1

a O -1 1

the O -1 1

Based O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
reviews O -1 1
for O -1 1

this O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
place O -1 1
I O -1 1
would O -1 1
reconsider O -1 1
revisiting O -1 1

definitely O -1 1
not O -1 1

We O -1 1
got O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
tipsy O -1 1

the O -1 1
sake B-ASP 1 1

isn't O -1 1
that O -1 1
what O -1 1
Saturday O -1 1

with O -1 1

all O -1 1
about? O -1 1

The O -1 1
restuarant O -1 1
itself O -1 1
is O -1 1
not O -1 1
large, O -1 1
but O -1 1
seems O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1
several O -1 1

But O -1 1
they O -1 1
don't O -1 1
have O -1 1
a O -1 1
toaster, B-ASP 0 1
which O -1 1
is O -1 1
strange. O -1 1

The O -1 1
worst O -1 1
though O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
taste. B-ASP 0 1

This O -1 1
place, B-ASP 2 1
however, O -1 1
has O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
less O -1 1
pretension O -1 1
than O -1 1

and O -1 1
the O -1 1

still O -1 1
above-average. O -1 1

I O -1 1
was O -1 1
back-to-back O -1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1

at O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
behind O -1 1
me O -1 1
and O -1 1
wait B-ASP 0 1
staff I-ASP 0 1
had O -1 1
to O -1 1
hoist O -1 1
trays O -1 1
over O -1 1
our O -1 1

as O -1 1
they O -1 1
squeezed O -1 1
past O -1 1
us O -1 1
again O -1 1
and O -1 1
again. O -1 1

The O -1 1
dim O -1 1
sum O -1 1
is O -1 1
ok O -1 1
but O -1 1
doesn't O -1 1
taste O -1 1

the O -1 1
little B-ASP 0 1

don't O -1 1
look O -1 1

should O -1 1
(also O -1 1
note O -1 1
lack O -1 1

The O -1 1

My O -1 1
suggestion O -1 1
is O -1 1
to O -1 1
eat B-ASP 2 1
family I-ASP 2 1
style I-ASP 2 1
because O -1 1
you'll O -1 1
want O -1 1
to O -1 1
try O -1 1
the O -1 1
other O -1 1

Besides O -1 1
having O -1 1
the O -1 1

we O -1 1

given O -1 1

we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1

after O -1 1
the O -1 1
rest O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1

had O -1 1
been O -1 1
served O -1 1

that O -1 1
order O -1 1
was O -1 1
undercooked), O -1 1
and O -1 1
charged O -1 1
$45 O -1 1
more O -1 1

we O -1 1

The O -1 1
porcini B-ASP 0 1

while O -1 1
the O -1 1

is O -1 1
still O -1 1
good, O -1 1
the O -1 1

due O -1 1
to O -1 1
its O -1 1
popularity, O -1 1
seems O -1 1
frantic. O -1 1

i O -1 1
don't O -1 1
usually O -1 1

it O -1 1

if O -1 1
we O -1 1

The O -1 1

absolutely O -1 1
horrible! O -1 1

They O -1 1

all O -1 1
very O -1 1

it's O -1 1
not O -1 1
outstanding O -1 1

but O -1 1
I've O -1 1
never O -1 1
been O -1 1

that O -1 1
i O -1 1
had O -1 1
to O -1 1
pay O -1 1
for O -1 1
lousy O -1 1
food. B-ASP 0 1

Only O -1 1
complaint O -1 1
would O -1 1
be O -1 1
that O -1 1
at O -1 1
an O -1 1
average O -1 1
cost O -1 1
of O -1 1

about O -1 1
finding O -1 1
a O -1 1

the O -1 1
food O -1 1
was O -1 1
undercooked-the O -1 1
sauce O -1 1
watery, O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
vegetables B-ASP 0 1
raw. O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
noisy O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiters O -1 1
are O -1 1
literally O -1 1
walking O -1 1
around O -1 1
doing O -1 1
things O -1 1
as O -1 1
fast O -1 1
as O -1 1
they O -1 1
can. O -1 1

There O -1 1
is O -1 1

times. O -1 1

The O -1 1
bruscetta O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
soggy, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
salads B-ASP 2 1
were O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1
included O -1 1
a O -1 1
nice O -1 1
mix O -1 1
of O -1 1

(not O -1 1
iceberg) O -1 1
all O -1 1

They O -1 1
charge O -1 1
$6.00 O -1 1
for O -1 1

The O -1 1
service O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
scatty O -1 1
at O -1 1
times O -1 1
but O -1 1
all O -1 1
is O -1 1
forgiven O -1 1
when O -1 1
the O -1 1

arrives. O -1 1

You O -1 1
rarely O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1

and O -1 1
the O -1 1
currys B-ASP 2 1

super O -1 1
spicy O -1 1
if O -1 1
you O -1 1
ask O -1 1
for O -1 1
it. O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu O -1 1
choices O -1 1
are O -1 1
similar O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
taste O -1 1
lacked O -1 1
more O -1 1
flavor B-ASP 0 1
than O -1 1
it O -1 1
looked. O -1 1

The O -1 1
sangria's O -1 1
- O -1 1
watered O -1 1
down. O -1 1

One O -1 1
would O -1 1
think O -1 1
we'd O -1 1
get O -1 1
an O -1 1
apology O -1 1
or O -1 1
complimentary O -1 1
drinks B-ASP 1 1
- B-ASP 1 1
instead, O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a O -1 1
snobby O -1 1
waiter O -1 1
wouldn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
take O -1 1
our O -1 1
order O -1 1
for O -1 1
15 O -1 1

us O -1 1
lip O -1 1
when O -1 1
we O -1 1
asked O -1 1
him O -1 1
to O -1 1

Pastrami O -1 1

high O -1 1
(ask O -1 1
for O -1 1
extra O -1 1
rye B-ASP 2 1
bread). I-ASP 2 1

The O -1 1
space O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
too O -1 1
small O -1 1
for O -1 1
live B-ASP 1 1
music, I-ASP 1 1
so O -1 1
on O -1 1
jazz O -1 1
nights, O -1 1
it O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
loud O -1 1
and O -1 1
cramped. O -1 1

After O -1 1
complaining O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
chicken O -1 1
dish, O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager B-ASP 0 1
came O -1 1
over O -1 1
to O -1 1
tell O -1 1
us O -1 1
that, O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
had O -1 1
ever O -1 1
complained O -1 1
before, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
know O -1 1
what O -1 1
the O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
supposed O -1 1
to O -1 1
taste O -1 1

They O -1 1
don't O -1 1
seem O -1 1
to O -1 1
place O -1 1
an O -1 1
emphasis O -1 1
on O -1 1

or O -1 1
fresh O -1 1

which O -1 1
to O -1 1
me O -1 1
is O -1 1
necessary O -1 1
for O -1 1

We O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
a O -1 1

it O -1 1

The O -1 1

the O -1 1

approached O -1 1

told O -1 1
us O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1

Always O -1 1
a O -1 1
nice O -1 1
crowd, B-ASP 2 1
but O -1 1
never O -1 1
loud. O -1 1

The O -1 1
waitstaff O -1 1
are O -1 1
all O -1 1
very O -1 1
busy, O -1 1
it's O -1 1
not O -1 1
outstanding O -1 1
service, B-ASP 3 1
but O -1 1
I've O -1 1
never O -1 1
been O -1 1
dealt O -1 1
with O -1 1
rudely. O -1 1

The O -1 1
food's O -1 1
dazzling O -1 1
flavors B-ASP 2 1
overwhelm O -1 1
the O -1 1
palate, O -1 1
truly O -1 1
embracing O -1 1
the O -1 1
beauty O -1 1
of O -1 1
authentic O -1 1
Thai O -1 1
cuisine. O -1 1

All O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
pizzas B-ASP 2 1
are O -1 1
terrific O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
price O -1 1
is O -1 1
even O -1 1
better! O -1 1

Besides O -1 1
having O -1 1
the O -1 1

The O -1 1
service O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
scatty O -1 1
at O -1 1
times O -1 1
but O -1 1
all O -1 1
is O -1 1
forgiven O -1 1
when O -1 1
the O -1 1

arrives. O -1 1

In O -1 1
terms O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
itself O -1 1
-- O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
special, O -1 1
we O -1 1
limited O -1 1

not O -1 1
worth O -1 1
trying. O -1 1

We O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
a O -1 1
tuna O -1 1

- O -1 1
it O -1 1
came O -1 1
with O -1 1
out O -1 1

which O -1 1
just O -1 1
made O -1 1
it O -1 1
a O -1 1
tuna O -1 1
sandwich. O -1 1

Perhaps O -1 1
this O -1 1
food B-ASP 3 1
is O -1 1
considered O -1 1
extreme O -1 1
to O -1 1
an O -1 1
Upper O -1 1
East O -1 1

resident, O -1 1
but O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
rest O -1 1
of O -1 1
us O -1 1
who've O -1 1
actually O -1 1
eaten O -1 1
ethnic O -1 1
food, O -1 1
this O -1 1
is O -1 1
simply O -1 1
dull. O -1 1

The O -1 1
space B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
too O -1 1
small O -1 1
for O -1 1
live O -1 1
music, O -1 1
so O -1 1
on O -1 1
jazz O -1 1
nights, O -1 1
it O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
loud O -1 1
and O -1 1
cramped. O -1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
disappointment O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
coat O -1 1
check O -1 1

who O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
seem O -1 1
to O -1 1

what O -1 1
a O -1 1

is O -1 1
on O -1 1

Based O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
reviews O -1 1
for O -1 1
dinner, B-ASP 2 1
this O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
place O -1 1
I O -1 1
would O -1 1
reconsider O -1 1
revisiting O -1 1
for O -1 1
that, O -1 1
but O -1 1
definitely O -1 1
not O -1 1
for O -1 1
Dim O -1 1
Sum O -1 1
again. O -1 1

After O -1 1
complaining O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
chicken O -1 1
dish, O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager B-ASP 0 1
came O -1 1
over O -1 1
to O -1 1
tell O -1 1
us O -1 1
that, O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
had O -1 1
ever O -1 1
complained O -1 1
before, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
know O -1 1
what O -1 1
the O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
supposed O -1 1
to O -1 1
taste O -1 1
like. O -1 1

The O -1 1
Dim B-ASP 1 1
Sum I-ASP 1 1
was O -1 1
so-so, O -1 1
but O -1 1
not O -1 1
spectacular. O -1 1

The O -1 1

the O -1 1

The O -1 1

The O -1 1

(we O -1 1
spent O -1 1
$160 O -1 1

extremely O -1 1

I O -1 1
tried O -1 1

told O -1 1
they O -1 1
were O -1 1
closed O -1 1
that O -1 1
weekend O -1 1

not O -1 1
go O -1 1
to O -1 1
Lucky O -1 1
Strike O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1

Make O -1 1
reservations B-ASP 0 1
but O -1 1
expect O -1 1
to O -1 1
be O -1 1
delayed O -1 1
15-20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
as O -1 1
the O -1 1

seating O -1 1
guests O -1 1
who O -1 1
arrived O -1 1
with O -1 1
a O -1 1

they O -1 1
probably O -1 1
had O -1 1
a O -1 1

close O -1 1

Even O -1 1
though O -1 1
its O -1 1
good O -1 1
seafood, B-ASP 2 1
the O -1 1

Yes, O -1 1
they're O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
more O -1 1
expensive O -1 1
then O -1 1
typical, O -1 1

then O -1 1
again, O -1 1

is O -1 1
their O -1 1

the O -1 1
greatest O -1 1
, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I O -1 1

that's O -1 1
how O -1 1

keep O -1 1
the O -1 1

actually O -1 1
eaten O -1 1

while O -1 1
the O -1 1

is O -1 1
still O -1 1
good, O -1 1
the O -1 1

due O -1 1
to O -1 1

seems O -1 1

My O -1 1

was O -1 1
the O -1 1
un-tasty O -1 1

presented O -1 1
well. O -1 1

The O -1 1

The O -1 1

a O -1 1

The O -1 1

isn't O -1 1
the O -1 1

but O -1 1
I O -1 1
suppose O -1 1
that's O -1 1
how O -1 1
they O -1 1
keep O -1 1
the O -1 1

Yes, O -1 1
they're O -1 1
a O -1 1

more O -1 1
expensive O -1 1
then O -1 1
typical, O -1 1

then O -1 1
again, O -1 1

badly O -1 1
it O -1 1

smaller O -1 1

before, O -1 1
a O -1 1

salty O -1 1
beyond O -1 1

a O -1 1

the O -1 1

came O -1 1
over O -1 1

what O -1 1
the O -1 1

The O -1 1

the O -1 1

wasn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
fully O -1 1
melted! O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
is O -1 1
noisy O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiters B-ASP 3 1

they O -1 1
can. O -1 1

I O -1 1
had O -1 1
their O -1 1

were O -1 1
the O -1 1

my O -1 1

I O -1 1
tried O -1 1
removing O -1 1

that O -1 1

the O -1 1

overly-ambitious O -1 1

while O -1 1
the O -1 1
service O -1 1
is O -1 1
still O -1 1
good, O -1 1
the O -1 1

due O -1 1
to O -1 1
its O -1 1
popularity, O -1 1
seems O -1 1

only O -1 1
weird O -1 1

was O -1 1
if O -1 1

absolutely O -1 1
horrible! O -1 1

Last O -1 1
memorial O -1 1
day, O -1 1
I O -1 1
tried O -1 1
to O -1 1
make O -1 1
reservations B-ASP 0 1

was O -1 1
told O -1 1
they O -1 1
were O -1 1
closed O -1 1
that O -1 1
weekend O -1 1
(interesting, O -1 1
but...). O -1 1

The O -1 1
large O -1 1
selection O -1 1
of O -1 1
bruschettas, O -1 1

the O -1 1
palate O -1 1
from O -1 1

One O -1 1
would O -1 1
think O -1 1
we'd O -1 1
get O -1 1
an O -1 1
apology O -1 1
or O -1 1
complimentary O -1 1
drinks B-ASP 1 1
- B-ASP 1 1
instead, O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a O -1 1
snobby O -1 1
waiter O -1 1
wouldn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
take O -1 1
our O -1 1
order O -1 1
for O -1 1
15 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
and O -1 1
gave O -1 1
us O -1 1

when O -1 1
we O -1 1
asked O -1 1
him O -1 1
to O -1 1

that, O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
had O -1 1

expect O -1 1
to O -1 1
be O -1 1
delayed O -1 1
15-20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
as O -1 1
the O -1 1

having O -1 1
difficulty O -1 1
seating B-ASP 0 1
guests O -1 1
who O -1 1
arrived O -1 1
with O -1 1
a O -1 1
reservation O -1 1
because O -1 1
they O -1 1
probably O -1 1
had O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
of O -1 1
walk O -1 1
ins O -1 1

so O -1 1
close O -1 1

I O -1 1
was O -1 1
in O -1 1
love O -1 1
with O -1 1
Pongsri O -1 1
on O -1 1
48th, O -1 1
but O -1 1
compared O -1 1
to O -1 1
Suan O -1 1
it O -1 1
is O -1 1
slow O -1 1
in O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
overpriced. O -1 1

Of O -1 1
course O -1 1
this O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
is O -1 1
lacking, O -1 1
but O -1 1
what O -1 1
do O -1 1
you O -1 1
expect O -1 1
from O -1 1
a O -1 1
24 O -1 1
hour O -1 1
bagel B-ASP 1 1
place O -1 1
anyways? O -1 1

It O -1 1
costs O -1 1
$2 O -1 1
extra O -1 1
to O -1 1
turn O -1 1
a O -1 1
regular O -1 1
roll O -1 1
into O -1 1
an O -1 1
inside-out O -1 1
roll, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
roll B-ASP 0 1
more O -1 1
than O -1 1
triples O -1 1
in O -1 1
size, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that's O -1 1
not O -1 1
just O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
rice. O -1 1

i O -1 1
don't O -1 1
usually O -1 1
order O -1 1
wine O -1 1
with O -1 1
indian O -1 1
so O -1 1
i O -1 1
can't O -1 1
comment O -1 1
on O -1 1
their O -1 1
wine B-ASP 1 1
list I-ASP 1 1
or O -1 1
their O -1 1
wines. O -1 1

The O -1 1
food O -1 1
was O -1 1
very O -1 1
expensive O -1 1
(we O -1 1
spent O -1 1
$160 O -1 1
for O -1 1
lunch B-ASP 0 1
for O -1 1
two) O -1 1
but O -1 1
extremely O -1 1
tasty. O -1 1

Always O -1 1
a O -1 1
nice O -1 1
crowd, B-ASP 2 1
but O -1 1
never O -1 1
loud. O -1 1

The O -1 1
portions O -1 1
are O -1 1
HUGE, O -1 1
so O -1 1
it O -1 1
might O -1 1
be O -1 1
good O -1 1
to O -1 1
order O -1 1
three O -1 1
things O -1 1
to O -1 1
split O -1 1
(rather O -1 1
than O -1 1
one O -1 1
appetizer O -1 1
and O -1 1
entree B-ASP 1 1
per O -1 1
person) O -1 1
for O -1 1
two O -1 1
people. O -1 1

The O -1 1
bruscetta O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
soggy, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
salads O -1 1
were O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1
included O -1 1
a O -1 1
nice O -1 1
mix O -1 1
of O -1 1
greens O -1 1
(not O -1 1
iceberg) O -1 1
all O -1 1
dishes B-ASP 2 1
are O -1 1
served O -1 1
piping O -1 1
hot O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
kitchen. O -1 1

And O -1 1
the O -1 1
Tom B-ASP 0 1
Kha I-ASP 0 1
soup I-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
pathetic. O -1 1

This O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
your O -1 1
corner O -1 1
Chinese B-ASP 1 1
food I-ASP 1 1
takeout. O -1 1

In O -1 1
fact, O -1 1
this O -1 1
was O -1 1
not O -1 1
a O -1 1
Nicoise B-ASP 0 1
salad I-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
was O -1 1
barely O -1 1
eatable. O -1 1

It O -1 1
is O -1 1
obvious O -1 1
that O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
has O -1 1
any O -1 1
idea O -1 1
about O -1 1
or O -1 1
experience O -1 1
with O -1 1
Japanese B-ASP 0 1
cuisine. O -1 1

The O -1 1
restuarant O -1 1
itself O -1 1
is O -1 1
not O -1 1
large, O -1 1
but O -1 1
seems O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1
several O -1 1
round O -1 1
tables O -1 1
to O -1 1
accomodate O -1 1
large O -1 1
groups O -1 1
hoping O -1 1
to O -1 1
save O -1 1
a O -1 1
buck O -1 1
to O -1 1
eat O -1 1
authentic O -1 1
Taiwanese. B-ASP 2 1

The O -1 1
decor B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
really O -1 1
blah, O -1 1
and O -1 1
not O -1 1
at O -1 1
all O -1 1
hip O -1 1
or O -1 1
happening. O -1 1

Yes, O -1 1
they're O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
more O -1 1
expensive O -1 1
then O -1 1
typical, O -1 1
but O -1 1
then O -1 1
again, O -1 1
so O -1 1
is O -1 1
their O -1 1
food. B-ASP 2 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
weird O -1 1
thing O -1 1
was O -1 1
if O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a(1) O -1 1
bottle, O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
would O -1 1
have O -1 1
simply O -1 1
multiplied O -1 1
the O -1 1
glass O -1 1
price O -1 1
X4, O -1 1
which O -1 1
makes O -1 1
no O -1 1
sense O -1 1
whatsoever(2). O -1 1

We O -1 1
couldn't O -1 1
carry O -1 1
our O -1 1
conversation O -1 1
as O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
routinely O -1 1
interrupted O -1 1
by O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
and O -1 1
servants B-ASP 0 1
asking O -1 1
us O -1 1
to O -1 1
order O -1 1
and O -1 1
hinting O -1 1
that O -1 1
we're O -1 1
taking O -1 1
too O -1 1
much O -1 1
time O -1 1
-- O -1 1
amazing, O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
sat O -1 1
down. O -1 1

Make O -1 1
reservations O -1 1
but O -1 1
expect O -1 1
to O -1 1
be O -1 1
delayed O -1 1
15-20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
as O -1 1
the O -1 1

close O -1 1
to O -1 1
Time O -1 1
Square. O -1 1

We O -1 1
actually O -1 1
gave O -1 1
10% O -1 1
tip B-ASP 0 1
(which O -1 1
we O -1 1
have O -1 1
never O -1 1
done O -1 1
despite O -1 1
mediocre O -1 1
food O -1 1
and O -1 1
service), O -1 1
because O -1 1
we O -1 1
felt O -1 1
totally O -1 1
ripped O -1 1
off. O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
greatest O -1 1
, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I O -1 1
suppose O -1 1
that's O -1 1
how O -1 1
they O -1 1
keep O -1 1
the O -1 1
prices B-ASP 2 1
down O -1 1
. O -1 1

I O -1 1
understand O -1 1
the O -1 1
area O -1 1
and O -1 1
folks O -1 1
you O -1 1
need O -1 1

experiance. O -1 1

The O -1 1
food O -1 1
was O -1 1
mediocre O -1 1
at O -1 1
best O -1 1
but O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
horrible O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
that O -1 1
made O -1 1
me O -1 1
vow O -1 1
never O -1 1
to O -1 1
go O -1 1
back. O -1 1

Everything, O -1 1
from O -1 1

below O -1 1

Don't O -1 1

The O -1 1

a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
too O -1 1
small O -1 1

so O -1 1
on O -1 1

it O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1

the O -1 1

I O -1 1
must O -1 1
say O -1 1
it's O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
pricey O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1

because O -1 1
it O -1 1

the O -1 1

the O -1 1

only O -1 1

was O -1 1
the O -1 1

The O -1 1
Singapore B-ASP 0 1
Mai I-ASP 0 1
Fun I-ASP 0 1
had O -1 1
NO O -1 1
curry O -1 1
flavor O -1 1
whatsoever. O -1 1

They O -1 1
smell O -1 1
like O -1 1
they O -1 1
stuff O -1 1
them O -1 1
with O -1 1
old O -1 1
canned O -1 1
vegetables O -1 1
like O -1 1
the O -1 1
spinach B-ASP 0 1

calzone. I-ASP 0 1

Authentic O -1 1
food B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
have O -1 1
REAL O -1 1
service, O -1 1
not O -1 1
just O -1 1
the O -1 1
rush O -1 1
you O -1 1
get O -1 1
sometimes O -1 1
when O -1 1
they O -1 1
try O -1 1
to O -1 1
push O -1 1
you O -1 1
out O -1 1
the O -1 1
door. O -1 1

The O -1 1
food B-ASP 2 1
is O -1 1
usually O -1 1
good O -1 1
but O -1 1
it O -1 1
certainly O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
a O -1 1
relaxing O -1 1
place O -1 1
to O -1 1
go. O -1 1

The O -1 1
seating B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
if O -1 1
they O -1 1
were O -1 1
trying O -1 1
to O -1 1
get O -1 1
the O -1 1
maximum O -1 1
amount O -1 1
of O -1 1
people O -1 1
into O -1 1
the O -1 1
restaurant, O -1 1
so O -1 1
be O -1 1
nice O -1 1
to O -1 1
your O -1 1
neighbor O -1 1
when O -1 1
you O -1 1
dine O -1 1
here. O -1 1

My O -1 1
biggest O -1 1
complaint O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
un-tasty O -1 1
food B-ASP 3 1
although O -1 1
presented O -1 1
well. O -1 1

We O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
a O -1 1
tuna O -1 1
melt O -1 1
- O -1 1
it O -1 1
came O -1 1
with O -1 1
out O -1 1
cheese O -1 1
which O -1 1
just O -1 1
made O -1 1
it O -1 1
a O -1 1
tuna B-ASP 0 1
sandwich. I-ASP 0 1

Drawbacks: O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
slow O -1 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
don't O -1 1
toast! O -1 1

Still, O -1 1
any O -1 1
quibbles O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
bill O -1 1
were O -1 1
off-set O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
pour-your-own O -1 1
measures B-ASP 2 1
of I-ASP 2 1
liquers I-ASP 2 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
courtesey O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
house... O -1 1

With O -1 1
the O -1 1
exception O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
lemon B-ASP 0 1
salad I-ASP 0 1

had O -1 1
so O -1 1
much O -1 1
pepper O -1 1
on O -1 1
it O -1 1
that O -1 1
our O -1 1
eyes O -1 1
started O -1 1
watering, O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
here O -1 1
was O -1 1
decent, O -1 1
not O -1 1
great. O -1 1

Oh, O -1 1
don't O -1 1
even O -1 1
let O -1 1
me O -1 1
start O -1 1
with O -1 1
how O -1 1
expensive O -1 1
the O -1 1
bills B-ASP 0 1
were! O -1 1

Try O -1 1

Even O -1 1
though O -1 1
its O -1 1
good O -1 1
seafood, B-ASP 2 1
the O -1 1

i O -1 1
don't O -1 1
usually O -1 1
order O -1 1

i O -1 1
can't O -1 1

the O -1 1

disappointed. O -1 1

The O -1 1
ambience O -1 1
was O -1 1
nice, O -1 1
but O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
wasn't O -1 1
so O -1 1
great. O -1 1

Authentic O -1 1
food B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
have O -1 1
REAL O -1 1
service, O -1 1
not O -1 1
just O -1 1
the O -1 1
rush O -1 1
you O -1 1
get O -1 1
sometimes O -1 1
when O -1 1
they O -1 1
try O -1 1
to O -1 1
push O -1 1
you O -1 1
out O -1 1
the O -1 1
door. O -1 1

we O -1 1
came O -1 1
here O -1 1
on O -1 1
a O -1 1
crowded O -1 1
saturday O -1 1
night O -1 1
and O -1 1
were O -1 1
seated O -1 1
right O -1 1

being O -1 1
15 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
late O -1 1
for O -1 1
our O -1 1
reservation. B-ASP 1 1

Only O -1 1
complaint O -1 1
would O -1 1
be O -1 1
that O -1 1
at O -1 1
an O -1 1
average O -1 1
cost O -1 1
of O -1 1
$12-$15 O -1 1
per O -1 1
meal, B-ASP 1 1
I'd O -1 1
like O -1 1
not O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
worry O -1 1
about O -1 1
finding O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat! O -1 1

Dinner B-ASP 0 1
took O -1 1
almost O -1 1
4 O -1 1
hours O -1 1

Oh, O -1 1
don't O -1 1
even O -1 1
let O -1 1
me O -1 1
start O -1 1
with O -1 1
how O -1 1
expensive O -1 1
the O -1 1

were! O -1 1

The O -1 1
Singapore B-ASP 0 1
Mai I-ASP 0 1
Fun I-ASP 0 1
had O -1 1
NO O -1 1
curry O -1 1

whatsoever. O -1 1

but O -1 1
when O -1 1
we O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
menu, O -1 1
there O -1 1
weren't O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
of O -1 1
choices, O -1 1
most O -1 1
of O -1 1
them O -1 1
were O -1 1
dumplings B-ASP 1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
appetizer O -1 1
section. O -1 1

the O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
undercooked-the O -1 1
sauce O -1 1
watery, O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
vegetables O -1 1
raw. O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere B-ASP 1 1
isn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
greatest O -1 1
, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I O -1 1
suppose O -1 1
that's O -1 1
how O -1 1
they O -1 1
keep O -1 1
the O -1 1
prices O -1 1
down O -1 1
. O -1 1

The O -1 1
food B-ASP 2 1

Oh O -1 1
yes, O -1 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
lie O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
phone, O -1 1
claiming O -1 1
they O -1 1
have O -1 1
seating O -1 1

then O -1 1
of O -1 1
course O -1 1
the O -1 1

One O -1 1
would O -1 1
think O -1 1
we'd O -1 1
get O -1 1
an O -1 1
apology O -1 1
or O -1 1
complimentary O -1 1
drinks B-ASP 1 1
- B-ASP 1 1
instead, O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a O -1 1
snobby O -1 1
waiter O -1 1
wouldn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
take O -1 1
our O -1 1
order O -1 1
for O -1 1
15 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
and O -1 1
gave O -1 1
us O -1 1
lip O -1 1
when O -1 1
we O -1 1
asked O -1 1
him O -1 1
to O -1 1
do O -1 1
so. O -1 1

The O -1 1
scallion B-ASP 1 1
pancakes I-ASP 1 1
and O -1 1
fried O -1 1
dumplings O -1 1
were O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
out O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
ordinary. O -1 1

Even O -1 1
though O -1 1
its O -1 1
good O -1 1
seafood, O -1 1
the O -1 1
prices B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
too O -1 1
high. O -1 1

The O -1 1
Dim B-ASP 1 1
Sum I-ASP 1 1
was O -1 1
so-so, O -1 1
but O -1 1
not O -1 1
spectacular. O -1 1

I O -1 1
was O -1 1
back-to-back O -1 1

the O -1 1

they O -1 1

again O -1 1
and O -1 1
again. O -1 1

A O -1 1
cheap O -1 1
eat B-ASP 2 1
for O -1 1
NYC, O -1 1
but O -1 1
not O -1 1
for O -1 1
dosa. O -1 1

The O -1 1
dim O -1 1
sum O -1 1
is O -1 1
ok O -1 1
but O -1 1
doesn't O -1 1
taste O -1 1
that O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
little B-ASP 0 1
dishes I-ASP 0 1
don't O -1 1
look O -1 1
steamy O -1 1
hot O -1 1
as O -1 1
they O -1 1
should O -1 1
(also O -1 1
note O -1 1
lack O -1 1
of O -1 1
Chinese O -1 1
here). O -1 1

In O -1 1
terms O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
itself O -1 1
-- O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
special, O -1 1
we O -1 1
limited O -1 1
ourselves O -1 1
to O -1 1
several O -1 1
appetizers. O -1 1

The O -1 1

really O -1 1
blah, O -1 1
and O -1 1
not O -1 1
at O -1 1
all O -1 1
hip O -1 1
or O -1 1
happening. O -1 1

After O -1 1
complaining O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
chicken O -1 1
dish, O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager B-ASP 0 1
came O -1 1
over O -1 1
to O -1 1
tell O -1 1
us O -1 1
that, O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
had O -1 1
ever O -1 1
complained O -1 1
before, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
know O -1 1
what O -1 1
the O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
supposed O -1 1
to O -1 1
taste O -1 1
like. O -1 1

Based O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
reviews O -1 1
for O -1 1

this O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
place O -1 1
I O -1 1
would O -1 1
reconsider O -1 1
revisiting O -1 1
for O -1 1
that, O -1 1
but O -1 1
definitely O -1 1
not O -1 1
for O -1 1
Dim B-ASP 0 1

Everything, O -1 1

incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
service O -1 1
to O -1 1
deliver O -1 1
below O -1 1
average O -1 1
food. O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
greatest O -1 1
, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I O -1 1
suppose O -1 1
that's O -1 1
how O -1 1
they O -1 1
keep O -1 1
the O -1 1
prices B-ASP 2 1
down O -1 1
. O -1 1

Pastrami B-ASP 2 1
or I-ASP 2 1
corned I-ASP 2 1
beef I-ASP 2 1
are O -1 1
juicy O -1 1
and O -1 1
piled O -1 1
high O -1 1
(ask O -1 1
for O -1 1
extra O -1 1
rye O -1 1
bread). O -1 1

I O -1 1
wouldn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
have O -1 1
complained O -1 1
at O -1 1
all O -1 1
if O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
at O -1 1
least O -1 1
tasted O -1 1
good O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
quality B-ASP 0 1
of I-ASP 0 1
food I-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
crappy, O -1 1
too. O -1 1

The O -1 1
crispy B-ASP 0 1
chicken I-ASP 0 1
wasn't O -1 1
for O -1 1
us, O -1 1
though. O -1 1

The O -1 1
hostess B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
were O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
and O -1 1
did O -1 1
everything O -1 1
they O -1 1
could O -1 1
to O -1 1
rush O -1 1
us O -1 1
out. O -1 1

They O -1 1
forgot O -1 1
a O -1 1
sandwich, O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
plastic O -1 1
forks, O -1 1
and O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
pita O -1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1
hummus B-ASP 1 1
platter. I-ASP 1 1

This O -1 1
place, B-ASP 2 1
however, O -1 1
has O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
less O -1 1
pretension O -1 1
than O -1 1
Joya O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
Thai O -1 1
food O -1 1
is O -1 1
still O -1 1
above-average. O -1 1

Perhaps O -1 1
this O -1 1
food O -1 1
is O -1 1
considered O -1 1
extreme O -1 1
to O -1 1
an O -1 1
Upper O -1 1

who've O -1 1
actually O -1 1
eaten O -1 1

The O -1 1
space O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
too O -1 1
small O -1 1
for O -1 1
live B-ASP 1 1
music, I-ASP 1 1
so O -1 1
on O -1 1
jazz O -1 1
nights, O -1 1
it O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
loud O -1 1
and O -1 1
cramped. O -1 1

Besides O -1 1
having O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
been O -1 1
promised O -1 1
given O -1 1
to O -1 1
other O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
patrons O -1 1
twice O -1 1
before O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
actually O -1 1
seated, O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
served O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
three O -1 1
times, O -1 1
received O -1 1
one O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
orders O -1 1
20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
after O -1 1
the O -1 1
rest O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
had O -1 1
been O -1 1
served B-ASP 0 1
(and O -1 1
that O -1 1
order O -1 1
was O -1 1
undercooked), O -1 1
and O -1 1
charged O -1 1
$45 O -1 1
more O -1 1
than O -1 1
we O -1 1
should O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
on O -1 1
our O -1 1
bill. O -1 1

This O -1 1
place, B-ASP 2 1
however, O -1 1
has O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
less O -1 1
pretension O -1 1
than O -1 1
Joya O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
Thai O -1 1
food O -1 1
is O -1 1
still O -1 1
above-average. O -1 1

After O -1 1
2 O -1 1
tries O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiter B-ASP 0 1
to O -1 1
take O -1 1
it O -1 1
away O -1 1
(we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
it O -1 1
yet, O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
full O -1 1
beers O -1 1
yet O -1 1
to O -1 1
drink), O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager O -1 1
approached O -1 1
and O -1 1
told O -1 1
us O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
for O -1 1
people O -1 1
with O -1 1
reservations. O -1 1

The O -1 1
folding B-ASP 0 1
chair I-ASP 0 1
I O -1 1
was O -1 1
seated O -1 1
at O -1 1
was O -1 1
uncomfortable. O -1 1

The O -1 1
hostess O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress B-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
and O -1 1
did O -1 1
everything O -1 1
they O -1 1
could O -1 1
to O -1 1
rush O -1 1
us O -1 1
out. O -1 1

The O -1 1
overall O -1 1
price B-ASP 0 1
tag I-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
very O -1 1
very O -1 1
expensive, O -1 1
something O -1 1
I O -1 1
did O -1 1
expect. O -1 1

If O -1 1
it's O -1 1
just O -1 1
a O -1 1
quick O -1 1

Based O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
reviews O -1 1
for O -1 1
dinner, B-ASP 2 1
this O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1

I O -1 1
would O -1 1

The O -1 1
food O -1 1
was O -1 1
not O -1 1
very O -1 1

the O -1 1

we O -1 1

The O -1 1

is O -1 1

the O -1 1

the O -1 1

cheap O -1 1

The O -1 1

itself O -1 1
is O -1 1
not O -1 1

seems O -1 1

Even O -1 1
though O -1 1
its O -1 1
good O -1 1

the O -1 1

The O -1 1

$6.00 O -1 1

to O -1 1
me O -1 1
is O -1 1
necessary O -1 1

This O -1 1

has O -1 1
a O -1 1

the O -1 1
Thai B-ASP 2 1

still O -1 1

But, O -1 1
they O -1 1
were O -1 1
too O -1 1
big O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1

the O -1 1

Still, O -1 1
any O -1 1

the O -1 1

stagnating. O -1 1

All O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1

are O -1 1
terrific O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
price O -1 1
is O -1 1
even O -1 1
better! O -1 1

For O -1 1
the O -1 1
price, B-ASP 2 1
you O -1 1
cannot O -1 1

this O -1 1

The O -1 1
Dim B-ASP 1 1
Sum I-ASP 1 1
was O -1 1
so-so, O -1 1

not O -1 1
spectacular. O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu O -1 1
changed, O -1 1
portions O -1 1
were O -1 1
even O -1 1
smaller O -1 1
than O -1 1
before, O -1 1
a O -1 1

a O -1 1
basmati B-ASP 0 1

lacked O -1 1

The O -1 1

a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
too O -1 1
small O -1 1
for O -1 1

so O -1 1
on O -1 1
jazz O -1 1

it O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
loud O -1 1

and O -1 1
again. O -1 1

One O -1 1
would O -1 1
think O -1 1
we'd O -1 1
get O -1 1
an O -1 1
apology O -1 1
or O -1 1
complimentary O -1 1
drinks O -1 1
- O -1 1
instead, O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a O -1 1
snobby O -1 1
waiter B-ASP 0 1
wouldn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
take O -1 1
our O -1 1
order O -1 1
for O -1 1
15 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
and O -1 1
gave O -1 1
us O -1 1
lip O -1 1
when O -1 1
we O -1 1
asked O -1 1
him O -1 1
to O -1 1
do O -1 1
so. O -1 1

The O -1 1
decor B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
really O -1 1
blah, O -1 1
and O -1 1
not O -1 1
at O -1 1
all O -1 1
hip O -1 1
or O -1 1
happening. O -1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
problem O -1 1
is O -1 1
that O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
complete O -1 1
incompetent. O -1 1

The O -1 1
ambience O -1 1
was O -1 1
nice, O -1 1
but O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
wasn't O -1 1
so O -1 1
great. O -1 1

Based O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
reviews O -1 1
for O -1 1
dinner, B-ASP 2 1
this O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
place O -1 1
I O -1 1
would O -1 1
reconsider O -1 1
revisiting O -1 1
for O -1 1
that, O -1 1
but O -1 1
definitely O -1 1
not O -1 1
for O -1 1
Dim O -1 1
Sum O -1 1
again. O -1 1

Besides O -1 1
having O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
we O -1 1

were O -1 1
served B-ASP 0 1

we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
three O -1 1
times, O -1 1

order O -1 1
was O -1 1
undercooked), O -1 1
and O -1 1
charged O -1 1
$45 O -1 1
more O -1 1
than O -1 1
we O -1 1
should O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
on O -1 1
our O -1 1
bill. O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu O -1 1
changed, O -1 1
portions B-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
even O -1 1
smaller O -1 1
than O -1 1
before, O -1 1
a O -1 1
lentil O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
salty O -1 1
beyond O -1 1
edibility, O -1 1
a O -1 1
basmati O -1 1
rice O -1 1
dish O -1 1
lacked O -1 1
flavor. O -1 1

The O -1 1
hot O -1 1

were O -1 1
cold O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
middle O -1 1

the O -1 1

stale. O -1 1

The O -1 1

all O -1 1
very O -1 1
busy, O -1 1
it's O -1 1
not O -1 1
outstanding O -1 1

I've O -1 1
never O -1 1
been O -1 1

I'm O -1 1

the O -1 1

even O -1 1
better! O -1 1

only O -1 1
disappointment O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1

who O -1 1
didn't O -1 1

is O -1 1
on O -1 1
a O -1 1
realtively O -1 1
non-busy O -1 1
night O -1 1
(for O -1 1
the O -1 1
coat O -1 1
check O -1 1
girls). O -1 1

The O -1 1
food's O -1 1
dazzling O -1 1
flavors B-ASP 2 1
overwhelm O -1 1
the O -1 1
palate, O -1 1
truly O -1 1
embracing O -1 1
the O -1 1
beauty O -1 1
of O -1 1
authentic O -1 1
Thai O -1 1
cuisine. O -1 1

The O -1 1
portions O -1 1
are O -1 1
now O -1 1
very O -1 1
small, O -1 1
the O -1 1
sauces O -1 1
are O -1 1
overly-ambitious O -1 1
usually O -1 1
inedible O -1 1
while O -1 1
the O -1 1
service B-ASP 2 1
is O -1 1
still O -1 1
good, O -1 1
the O -1 1
restaurant, O -1 1
due O -1 1
to O -1 1
its O -1 1
popularity, O -1 1
seems O -1 1
frantic. O -1 1

They O -1 1
charge O -1 1
$6.00 O -1 1
for O -1 1
rice. B-ASP 0 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
weird O -1 1
thing O -1 1
was O -1 1
if O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a(1) O -1 1
bottle, O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
would O -1 1
have O -1 1
simply O -1 1
multiplied O -1 1
the O -1 1
glass O -1 1
price O -1 1
X4, O -1 1
which O -1 1
makes O -1 1
no O -1 1
sense O -1 1
whatsoever(2). O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
greatest O -1 1
, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I O -1 1
suppose O -1 1
that's O -1 1
how O -1 1
they O -1 1
keep O -1 1
the O -1 1
prices B-ASP 2 1
down O -1 1
. O -1 1

A O -1 1
cheap O -1 1
eat B-ASP 2 1
for O -1 1
NYC, O -1 1
but O -1 1
not O -1 1
for O -1 1
dosa. O -1 1

My O -1 1
suggestion O -1 1
is O -1 1
to O -1 1
eat B-ASP 2 1
family I-ASP 2 1
style I-ASP 2 1
because O -1 1
you'll O -1 1
want O -1 1
to O -1 1
try O -1 1

i O -1 1
don't O -1 1
usually O -1 1

The O -1 1
portions O -1 1
are O -1 1
HUGE, O -1 1

it O -1 1
might O -1 1
be O -1 1
good O -1 1

about O -1 1

incredibly O -1 1

below O -1 1

is O -1 1
usually O -1 1
good O -1 1

it O -1 1
certainly O -1 1

Yes, O -1 1
they're O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
more O -1 1
expensive O -1 1
then O -1 1
typical, O -1 1

the O -1 1

Dinner B-ASP 0 1
took O -1 1
almost O -1 1
4 O -1 1
hours O -1 1
without O -1 1
any O -1 1
lag O -1 1

different O -1 1

all O -1 1

us O -1 1
who've O -1 1
actually O -1 1
eaten O -1 1
ethnic O -1 1

this O -1 1
is O -1 1
simply O -1 1
dull. O -1 1

the O -1 1

more O -1 1
than O -1 1
triples O -1 1
in O -1 1
size, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that's O -1 1
not O -1 1

After O -1 1
complaining O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
chicken B-ASP 0 1
dish, I-ASP 0 1
the O -1 1
manager O -1 1
came O -1 1
over O -1 1
to O -1 1
tell O -1 1
us O -1 1
that, O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
had O -1 1
ever O -1 1
complained O -1 1
before, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
know O -1 1
what O -1 1
the O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
supposed O -1 1
to O -1 1
taste O -1 1
like. O -1 1

They O -1 1
forgot O -1 1
a O -1 1
sandwich, B-ASP 1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
plastic O -1 1
forks, O -1 1
and O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
pita O -1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1
hummus O -1 1
platter. O -1 1

Knowledge O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
chef B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
are O -1 1
below O -1 1
average. O -1 1

The O -1 1
porcini B-ASP 0 1
mushroom I-ASP 0 1
pasta I-ASP 0 1
special I-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
tasteless, O -1 1
so O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
seafood O -1 1
tagliatelle. O -1 1

Their O -1 1
calzones B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
horrific, O -1 1
bad, O -1 1
vomit-inducing, O -1 1
YUCK. O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu O -1 1
changed, O -1 1
portions O -1 1
were O -1 1
even O -1 1
smaller O -1 1
than O -1 1
before, O -1 1
a O -1 1
lentil O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
salty O -1 1
beyond O -1 1
edibility, O -1 1
a O -1 1
basmati B-ASP 0 1
rice I-ASP 0 1
dish I-ASP 0 1
lacked O -1 1
flavor. O -1 1

Knowledge O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
chef B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
are O -1 1
below O -1 1
average. O -1 1

Everything, O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
soft O -1 1
bread, B-ASP 0 1
soggy O -1 1
salad, O -1 1
and O -1 1
50 O -1 1
minute O -1 1
wait O -1 1
time, O -1 1
with O -1 1
an O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
service O -1 1
to O -1 1
deliver O -1 1
below O -1 1
average O -1 1
food. O -1 1

The O -1 1
Steak B-ASP 2 1
Tartare I-ASP 2 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
great O -1 1
bet, O -1 1
they O -1 1
fix O -1 1
it O -1 1
for O -1 1
you O -1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
table. O -1 1

We O -1 1
actually O -1 1
gave O -1 1
10% O -1 1
tip B-ASP 0 1
(which O -1 1
we O -1 1
have O -1 1
never O -1 1
done O -1 1
despite O -1 1
mediocre O -1 1
food O -1 1
and O -1 1
service), O -1 1
because O -1 1
we O -1 1
felt O -1 1
totally O -1 1
ripped O -1 1
off. O -1 1

This O -1 1
place, B-ASP 2 1
however, O -1 1
has O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
less O -1 1
pretension O -1 1
than O -1 1
Joya O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
Thai O -1 1
food O -1 1
is O -1 1
still O -1 1
above-average. O -1 1

My O -1 1
suggestion O -1 1
is O -1 1
to O -1 1
eat B-ASP 2 1
family I-ASP 2 1
style I-ASP 2 1
because O -1 1
you'll O -1 1
want O -1 1
to O -1 1
try O -1 1
the O -1 1
other O -1 1
dishes. O -1 1

It's O -1 1
super-trendy O -1 1
and O -1 1
there's O -1 1
always O -1 1
someone O -1 1
to O -1 1
take O -1 1
that O -1 1
empty O -1 1
seat, B-ASP 1 1
so O -1 1
it O -1 1
seems O -1 1
that O -1 1
customer O -1 1
service O -1 1
has O -1 1
been O -1 1
deemed O -1 1
not O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
essence. O -1 1

The O -1 1
rice O -1 1
was O -1 1
poor O -1 1
quality O -1 1
and O -1 1
was O -1 1
cooked B-ASP 0 1
so O -1 1
badly O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
hard. O -1 1

The O -1 1
restuarant O -1 1
itself O -1 1
is O -1 1
not O -1 1
large, O -1 1
but O -1 1
seems O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1
several O -1 1
round O -1 1
tables O -1 1
to O -1 1
accomodate O -1 1
large O -1 1
groups O -1 1
hoping O -1 1
to O -1 1
save O -1 1
a O -1 1
buck O -1 1
to O -1 1
eat O -1 1
authentic O -1 1
Taiwanese. B-ASP 2 1

The O -1 1
hot O -1 1
dogs O -1 1
were O -1 1
cold O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
middle O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
buns B-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
stale. O -1 1

Late O -1 1
nite O -1 1
omelletes B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
not O -1 1
good O -1 1
here, O -1 1
there O -1 1
is O -1 1
no O -1 1
variety! O -1 1

The O -1 1
scallion B-ASP 1 1
pancakes I-ASP 1 1
and O -1 1
fried O -1 1
dumplings O -1 1
were O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
out O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
ordinary. O -1 1

Here's O -1 1
to O -1 1
the O -1 1
fake O -1 1
fish B-ASP 0 1
tanks I-ASP 0 1
too... O -1 1

With O -1 1
the O -1 1
exception O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
lemon O -1 1
salad O -1 1
that O -1 1
had O -1 1
so O -1 1
much O -1 1
pepper O -1 1
on O -1 1
it O -1 1
that O -1 1
our O -1 1
eyes O -1 1
started O -1 1
watering, O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
here O -1 1
was O -1 1
decent, O -1 1
not O -1 1
great. O -1 1

I O -1 1
am O -1 1
reluctant O -1 1
to O -1 1
write O -1 1
because O -1 1
I O -1 1
would O -1 1
not O -1 1
want O -1 1
my O -1 1
jem O -1 1
of O -1 1
a O -1 1
pizza B-ASP 2 1
place O -1 1
to O -1 1
become O -1 1
overcrowded. O -1 1

You O -1 1
rarely O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
currys O -1 1
(masaman, O -1 1
green, O -1 1
red) O -1 1
are O -1 1
full O -1 1
of O -1 1
flavor B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
come O -1 1
super O -1 1
spicy O -1 1
if O -1 1
you O -1 1
ask O -1 1
for O -1 1
it. O -1 1

The O -1 1
seating B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
if O -1 1
they O -1 1
were O -1 1
trying O -1 1
to O -1 1
get O -1 1
the O -1 1
maximum O -1 1
amount O -1 1
of O -1 1
people O -1 1
into O -1 1
the O -1 1
restaurant, O -1 1

nice O -1 1
to O -1 1
your O -1 1

when O -1 1
you O -1 1
dine O -1 1
here. O -1 1

After O -1 1
2 O -1 1
tries O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiter B-ASP 0 1
to O -1 1
take O -1 1
it O -1 1
away O -1 1
(we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
it O -1 1
yet, O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
full O -1 1
beers O -1 1
yet O -1 1
to O -1 1
drink), O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager O -1 1
approached O -1 1
and O -1 1
told O -1 1
us O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
for O -1 1
people O -1 1
with O -1 1
reservations. O -1 1

The O -1 1
hostess O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress B-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
and O -1 1
did O -1 1
everything O -1 1
they O -1 1
could O -1 1
to O -1 1
rush O -1 1
us O -1 1
out. O -1 1

Based O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
reviews O -1 1
for O -1 1
dinner, O -1 1
this O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
place O -1 1
I O -1 1
would O -1 1
reconsider O -1 1
revisiting O -1 1
for O -1 1
that, O -1 1
but O -1 1
definitely O -1 1
not O -1 1
for O -1 1
Dim B-ASP 0 1
Sum I-ASP 0 1

The O -1 1
folding B-ASP 0 1
chair I-ASP 0 1
I O -1 1
was O -1 1
seated O -1 1
at O -1 1
was O -1 1
uncomfortable. O -1 1

The O -1 1
pizza B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
delivered O -1 1
cold O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
cheese O -1 1
wasn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
fully O -1 1
melted! O -1 1

The O -1 1

15-20 O -1 1

a O -1 1

Oh O -1 1
yes, O -1 1

they O -1 1

there O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
work O -1 1
dinner B-ASP 1 1
not O -1 1
long O -1 1
ago O -1 1
when O -1 1
my O -1 1
colleague O -1 1
from O -1 1
London O -1 1
noticed O -1 1
a O -1 1
very O -1 1
large O -1 1
waterbug O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
ceiling. O -1 1

Authentic O -1 1
food B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
have O -1 1
REAL O -1 1
service, O -1 1
not O -1 1
just O -1 1
the O -1 1
rush O -1 1
you O -1 1
get O -1 1
sometimes O -1 1
when O -1 1
they O -1 1
try O -1 1
to O -1 1
push O -1 1
you O -1 1
out O -1 1
the O -1 1
door. O -1 1

After O -1 1
complaining O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
chicken B-ASP 0 1
dish, I-ASP 0 1
the O -1 1
manager O -1 1
came O -1 1
over O -1 1
to O -1 1
tell O -1 1
us O -1 1
that, O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
had O -1 1
ever O -1 1
complained O -1 1
before, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
know O -1 1
what O -1 1
the O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
supposed O -1 1
to O -1 1
taste O -1 1
like. O -1 1

Oh O -1 1
yes, O -1 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
lie O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
phone, O -1 1
claiming O -1 1
they O -1 1
have O -1 1
seating B-ASP 1 1
in I-ASP 1 1
the I-ASP 1 1
garden, I-ASP 1 1
then O -1 1
of O -1 1
course O -1 1
the O -1 1
seats O -1 1
are O -1 1
not O -1 1
available. O -1 1

I'm O -1 1
still O -1 1
mad O -1 1
that O -1 1
i O -1 1
had O -1 1
to O -1 1
pay O -1 1
for O -1 1
lousy O -1 1
food. B-ASP 0 1

Go O -1 1
to O -1 1
Volare O -1 1
for O -1 1
1st O -1 1
class O -1 1
service B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
terrific O -1 1
food. O -1 1

I O -1 1
went O -1 1
there O -1 1
in O -1 1
late O -1 1
afternoon O -1 1
for O -1 1
some O -1 1
bite O -1 1
size O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
and O -1 1
refleshment O -1 1
with O -1 1
my O -1 1
date. O -1 1

Behind O -1 1
this O -1 1
counter, B-ASP 0 1
two O -1 1
men O -1 1
are O -1 1
squeezed O -1 1
in. O -1 1

I O -1 1
am O -1 1
reluctant O -1 1
to O -1 1
write O -1 1
because O -1 1
I O -1 1
would O -1 1
not O -1 1
want O -1 1
my O -1 1
jem O -1 1
of O -1 1
a O -1 1
pizza B-ASP 2 1
place O -1 1
to O -1 1
become O -1 1
overcrowded. O -1 1

After O -1 1
2 O -1 1
tries O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiter O -1 1
to O -1 1
take O -1 1
it O -1 1
away O -1 1
(we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
it O -1 1
yet, O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
full O -1 1
beers B-ASP 1 1
yet O -1 1
to O -1 1
drink), O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager O -1 1
approached O -1 1
and O -1 1
told O -1 1
us O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
for O -1 1
people O -1 1
with O -1 1
reservations. O -1 1

It O -1 1
won't O -1 1
break O -1 1
the O -1 1
bank O -1 1
but O -1 1
I O -1 1
also O -1 1
wouldnt O -1 1
come O -1 1
back O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
food. B-ASP 0 1

In O -1 1
terms O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
itself O -1 1
-- O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
special, O -1 1
we O -1 1
limited O -1 1
ourselves O -1 1
to O -1 1
several O -1 1
appetizers. B-ASP 1 1

Service B-ASP 3 1
is O -1 1
not O -1 1
exactly O -1 1
five O -1 1
star, O -1 1
but O -1 1
thats O -1 1
not O -1 1
really O -1 1
a O -1 1
big O -1 1
deal. O -1 1

The O -1 1
hostess O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress B-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
and O -1 1
did O -1 1
everything O -1 1
they O -1 1
could O -1 1
to O -1 1
rush O -1 1
us O -1 1
out. O -1 1

Drawbacks: O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
slow O -1 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
don't O -1 1
toast! O -1 1

All O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
pizzas B-ASP 2 1
are O -1 1
terrific O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
price O -1 1
is O -1 1
even O -1 1
better! O -1 1

Went O -1 1
there O -1 1
with O -1 1
my O -1 1
wife O -1 1
and O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
table O -1 1
even O -1 1
though O -1 1
you O -1 1
could O -1 1
see O -1 1
there O -1 1
many O -1 1
that O -1 1
were O -1 1
empty O -1 1
with O -1 1
not O -1 1
reservation B-ASP 1 1
sigh I-ASP 1 1
on O -1 1
them. O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
noisy O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiters O -1 1
are O -1 1
literally O -1 1
walking O -1 1
around O -1 1
doing O -1 1
things O -1 1
as O -1 1
fast O -1 1
as O -1 1
they O -1 1
can. O -1 1

I O -1 1
had O -1 1
their O -1 1
eggs B-ASP 0 1
benedict I-ASP 0 1
for O -1 1
brunch, O -1 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
the O -1 1
worst O -1 1
in O -1 1
my O -1 1
entire O -1 1
life, O -1 1
I O -1 1
tried O -1 1
removing O -1 1
the O -1 1
hollondaise O -1 1
sauce O -1 1
completely O -1 1
that O -1 1
was O -1 1
how O -1 1
failed O -1 1
it O -1 1
was. O -1 1

In O -1 1
terms O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1

nothing O -1 1
special, O -1 1
we O -1 1

Oh, O -1 1
don't O -1 1
even O -1 1
let O -1 1
me O -1 1
start O -1 1
with O -1 1
how O -1 1
expensive O -1 1
the O -1 1
bills B-ASP 0 1
were! O -1 1

The O -1 1
entree O -1 1
was O -1 1
bland O -1 1
and O -1 1
small, O -1 1
dessert B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
not O -1 1
inspired. O -1 1

My O -1 1
suggestion O -1 1
is O -1 1
to O -1 1
eat O -1 1
family O -1 1
style O -1 1
because O -1 1
you'll O -1 1
want O -1 1
to O -1 1
try O -1 1
the O -1 1
other O -1 1
dishes. B-ASP 1 1

The O -1 1
folding B-ASP 0 1
chair I-ASP 0 1
I O -1 1
was O -1 1
seated O -1 1
at O -1 1
was O -1 1
uncomfortable. O -1 1

Try O -1 1
the O -1 1
olive O -1 1
cream O -1 1
cheese O -1 1
or O -1 1
the O -1 1
lox B-ASP 2 1
spread I-ASP 2 1

a O -1 1
whole O -1 1

I O -1 1
was O -1 1
in O -1 1
love O -1 1
with O -1 1
Pongsri O -1 1
on O -1 1
48th, O -1 1
but O -1 1
compared O -1 1
to O -1 1
Suan O -1 1
it O -1 1
is O -1 1
slow O -1 1
in O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
overpriced. O -1 1

The O -1 1
space O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
too O -1 1
small O -1 1
for O -1 1
live O -1 1
music, O -1 1
so O -1 1
on O -1 1
jazz B-ASP 1 1
nights, I-ASP 1 1
it O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
loud O -1 1
and O -1 1
cramped. O -1 1

Sauce O -1 1
was O -1 1
watery O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
have O -1 1
much O -1 1
flavor. B-ASP 0 1

While O -1 1
the O -1 1
ambiance O -1 1
and O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
were O -1 1
great, O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
service O -1 1
could O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
better. O -1 1

The O -1 1
food's O -1 1
dazzling O -1 1
flavors B-ASP 2 1
overwhelm O -1 1
the O -1 1
palate, O -1 1
truly O -1 1
embracing O -1 1
the O -1 1
beauty O -1 1
of O -1 1
authentic O -1 1
Thai O -1 1
cuisine. O -1 1

The O -1 1
Singapore B-ASP 0 1
Mai I-ASP 0 1
Fun I-ASP 0 1
had O -1 1
NO O -1 1
curry O -1 1
flavor O -1 1
whatsoever. O -1 1

I O -1 1
am O -1 1
reluctant O -1 1
to O -1 1
write O -1 1
because O -1 1
I O -1 1
would O -1 1
not O -1 1
want O -1 1
my O -1 1
jem O -1 1
of O -1 1
a O -1 1
pizza B-ASP 2 1
place O -1 1
to O -1 1
become O -1 1
overcrowded. O -1 1

Went O -1 1
there O -1 1
with O -1 1
my O -1 1
wife O -1 1
and O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
table B-ASP 0 1
even O -1 1
though O -1 1
you O -1 1
could O -1 1
see O -1 1
there O -1 1
many O -1 1
that O -1 1
were O -1 1
empty O -1 1

not O -1 1
reservation O -1 1
sigh O -1 1
on O -1 1
them. O -1 1

I O -1 1
understand O -1 1
the O -1 1
area O -1 1
and O -1 1
folks O -1 1
you O -1 1
need O -1 1
not O -1 1
come O -1 1
here O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
romantic, O -1 1
alluring O -1 1
ambiance O -1 1
or O -1 1
the O -1 1
five O -1 1
star O -1 1
service O -1 1
featuring O -1 1
a O -1 1
sommlier O -1 1
and O -1 1
a O -1 1
complicated O -1 1
maze O -1 1
of O -1 1
captain O -1 1
and O -1 1
back O -1 1
waiters O -1 1
- O -1 1
you O -1 1
come O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
authentic O -1 1
foods, B-ASP 2 1
the O -1 1
tastes, O -1 1
the O -1 1
experiance. O -1 1

Service B-ASP 0 1
could O -1 1
be O -1 1
improved O -1 1
but O -1 1
overall O -1 1
this O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
place O -1 1
that O -1 1
understands O -1 1
the O -1 1
importance O -1 1
of O -1 1
little O -1 1
things O -1 1
(the O -1 1
heavy, O -1 1
black, O -1 1
antique-seeming O -1 1
teapot, O -1 1
for O -1 1
one) O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
experience. O -1 1

Immediately O -1 1
after O -1 1
we O -1 1
paid, O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiter B-ASP 0 1
took O -1 1
the O -1 1
money O -1 1
and O -1 1
said, O -1 1
okay, O -1 1
you O -1 1
guys O -1 1
are O -1 1
outta O -1 1
here. O -1 1

The O -1 1
food O -1 1
was O -1 1
mediocre O -1 1
at O -1 1
best O -1 1
but O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
horrible O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
that O -1 1
made O -1 1
me O -1 1
vow O -1 1
never O -1 1
to O -1 1
go O -1 1
back. O -1 1

The O -1 1
bruscetta O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
soggy, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
salads O -1 1
were O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1
included O -1 1
a O -1 1
nice O -1 1
mix B-ASP 2 1
of I-ASP 2 1
greens I-ASP 2 1
(not O -1 1
iceberg) O -1 1
all O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
are O -1 1
served O -1 1
piping O -1 1
hot O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
kitchen. O -1 1

They O -1 1
forgot O -1 1
a O -1 1
sandwich, O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
plastic O -1 1
forks, O -1 1
and O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
pita O -1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1
hummus B-ASP 1 1
platter. I-ASP 1 1

Even O -1 1
though O -1 1
its O -1 1
good O -1 1
seafood, B-ASP 2 1
the O -1 1
prices O -1 1
are O -1 1
too O -1 1
high. O -1 1

but O -1 1
when O -1 1
we O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
menu, O -1 1
there O -1 1
weren't O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
of O -1 1
choices, O -1 1
most O -1 1
of O -1 1
them O -1 1
were O -1 1
dumplings B-ASP 1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
appetizer O -1 1
section. O -1 1

The O -1 1
decor B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
really O -1 1
blah, O -1 1
and O -1 1
not O -1 1
at O -1 1
all O -1 1
hip O -1 1
or O -1 1
happening. O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu O -1 1
choices O -1 1
are O -1 1
similar O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
taste B-ASP 0 1
lacked O -1 1
more O -1 1
flavor O -1 1
than O -1 1
it O -1 1
looked. O -1 1

The O -1 1
restuarant O -1 1
itself O -1 1
is O -1 1
not O -1 1
large, O -1 1
but O -1 1
seems O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1
several O -1 1
round B-ASP 2 1
tables I-ASP 2 1
to O -1 1
accomodate O -1 1
large O -1 1
groups O -1 1
hoping O -1 1
to O -1 1
save O -1 1
a O -1 1
buck O -1 1
to O -1 1
eat O -1 1
authentic O -1 1
Taiwanese. O -1 1

The O -1 1
portions O -1 1
are O -1 1
HUGE, O -1 1
so O -1 1
it O -1 1
might O -1 1
be O -1 1
good O -1 1
to O -1 1
order O -1 1
three O -1 1
things O -1 1
to O -1 1
split O -1 1
(rather O -1 1
than O -1 1
one O -1 1
appetizer B-ASP 1 1
and O -1 1
entree O -1 1
per O -1 1
person) O -1 1
for O -1 1
two O -1 1
people. O -1 1

But, O -1 1
they O -1 1
were O -1 1
too O -1 1
big O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
bun. B-ASP 1 1

The O -1 1
two O -1 1
star O -1 1
chefs B-ASP 1 1
left O -1 1
quite O -1 1
some O -1 1
time O -1 1
ago O -1 1
to O -1 1
open O -1 1
their O -1 1
own O -1 1
place. O -1 1

The O -1 1
ambience O -1 1
was O -1 1
nice, O -1 1
but O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
wasn't O -1 1
so O -1 1
great. O -1 1

I O -1 1
must O -1 1
say O -1 1
it's O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
pricey O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
because O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
not O -1 1
as O -1 1
spectacular O -1 1
as O -1 1
the O -1 1
view. O -1 1

The O -1 1
folding B-ASP 0 1
chair I-ASP 0 1
I O -1 1
was O -1 1
seated O -1 1
at O -1 1
was O -1 1
uncomfortable. O -1 1

While O -1 1
the O -1 1
ambiance O -1 1
and O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
were O -1 1
great, O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
service O -1 1
could O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
better. O -1 1

They O -1 1
don't O -1 1
seem O -1 1
to O -1 1
place O -1 1
an O -1 1
emphasis O -1 1
on O -1 1
specials B-ASP 0 1
or O -1 1
fresh O -1 1
ingredients O -1 1
which O -1 1
to O -1 1
me O -1 1
is O -1 1
necessary O -1 1
for O -1 1
good O -1 1
thai. O -1 1

The O -1 1
scallion O -1 1
pancakes O -1 1
and O -1 1
fried B-ASP 1 1
dumplings I-ASP 1 1
were O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
out O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
ordinary. O -1 1

One O -1 1
should O -1 1
not O -1 1
go O -1 1
to O -1 1
Lucky O -1 1
Strike O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
food. B-ASP 0 1

The O -1 1

but O -1 1
I O -1 1
also O -1 1
wouldnt O -1 1
come O -1 1
back O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
food. B-ASP 0 1

The O -1 1
menu O -1 1
choices O -1 1
are O -1 1
similar O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
taste O -1 1
lacked O -1 1
more O -1 1
flavor B-ASP 0 1
than O -1 1
it O -1 1
looked. O -1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
disappointment O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
coat B-ASP 0 1
check I-ASP 0 1
girls I-ASP 0 1
who O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
seem O -1 1
to O -1 1
know O -1 1
what O -1 1
a O -1 1
customer O -1 1
is O -1 1
on O -1 1
a O -1 1
realtively O -1 1
non-busy O -1 1
night O -1 1
(for O -1 1
the O -1 1
coat O -1 1
check O -1 1
girls). O -1 1

Great O -1 1
food O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
dreadful! O -1 1

The O -1 1
two O -1 1
star O -1 1
chefs B-ASP 1 1
left O -1 1
quite O -1 1
some O -1 1
time O -1 1
ago O -1 1
to O -1 1
open O -1 1
their O -1 1
own O -1 1
place. O -1 1

We O -1 1
were O -1 1
fans O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
half-price O -1 1
Saturday O -1 1
night O -1 1
option O -1 1
until O -1 1
some O -1 1
inedible O -1 1
squid B-ASP 0 1
during O -1 1
a O -1 1
recent O -1 1
visit. O -1 1

The O -1 1
space O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
too O -1 1
small O -1 1
for O -1 1
live B-ASP 1 1
music, I-ASP 1 1
so O -1 1
on O -1 1
jazz O -1 1
nights, O -1 1
it O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
loud O -1 1
and O -1 1
cramped. O -1 1

The O -1 1
sangria's O -1 1
- O -1 1
watered O -1 1
down. O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere B-ASP 1 1
isn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
greatest O -1 1
, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I O -1 1
suppose O -1 1
that's O -1 1
how O -1 1
they O -1 1
keep O -1 1
the O -1 1
prices O -1 1
down O -1 1
. O -1 1

The O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
absolutely O -1 1
horrible! O -1 1

However, O -1 1
I O -1 1
was O -1 1
there O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
work O -1 1
dinner B-ASP 1 1
not O -1 1
long O -1 1
ago O -1 1
when O -1 1
my O -1 1
colleague O -1 1
from O -1 1
London O -1 1
noticed O -1 1
a O -1 1
very O -1 1
large O -1 1
waterbug O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
ceiling. O -1 1

Knowledge O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
chef O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
below O -1 1
average. O -1 1

Try O -1 1
the O -1 1
olive O -1 1
cream O -1 1
cheese O -1 1
or O -1 1
the O -1 1
lox B-ASP 2 1

While O -1 1
the O -1 1
ambiance O -1 1
and O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
were O -1 1
great, O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1

been O -1 1
a O -1 1

better. O -1 1

subpar O -1 1

has O -1 1
no O -1 1

Were O -1 1
meeting O -1 1
up O -1 1
with O -1 1
some O -1 1

for O -1 1
a O -1 1

Based O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1

for O -1 1

this O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
place O -1 1
I O -1 1
would O -1 1
reconsider O -1 1
revisiting O -1 1
for O -1 1
that, O -1 1
but O -1 1
definitely O -1 1
not O -1 1
for O -1 1
Dim B-ASP 0 1
Sum I-ASP 0 1
again. O -1 1

With O -1 1
the O -1 1
exception O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
lemon B-ASP 0 1
salad I-ASP 0 1
that O -1 1
had O -1 1
so O -1 1
much O -1 1

it O -1 1

our O -1 1

the O -1 1
food O -1 1
here O -1 1
was O -1 1
decent, O -1 1
not O -1 1
great. O -1 1

Still, O -1 1
any O -1 1
quibbles O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1

Perhaps O -1 1
this O -1 1
food O -1 1
is O -1 1
considered O -1 1
extreme O -1 1
to O -1 1
an O -1 1
Upper O -1 1
East O -1 1
Side O -1 1
resident, O -1 1
but O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
rest O -1 1
of O -1 1
us O -1 1
who've O -1 1
actually O -1 1
eaten O -1 1
ethnic B-ASP 0 1
food, I-ASP 0 1
this O -1 1
is O -1 1
simply O -1 1
dull. O -1 1

The O -1 1
decor B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
really O -1 1
blah, O -1 1
and O -1 1
not O -1 1
at O -1 1
all O -1 1
hip O -1 1
or O -1 1
happening. O -1 1

Everything, O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
soft O -1 1
bread, B-ASP 0 1
soggy O -1 1
salad, O -1 1
and O -1 1
50 O -1 1
minute O -1 1
wait O -1 1
time, O -1 1
with O -1 1
an O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
service O -1 1
to O -1 1
deliver O -1 1
below O -1 1
average O -1 1
food. O -1 1

We O -1 1
actually O -1 1
gave O -1 1
10% O -1 1
tip O -1 1
(which O -1 1
we O -1 1
have O -1 1
never O -1 1
done O -1 1
despite O -1 1
mediocre O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
and O -1 1
service), O -1 1
because O -1 1
we O -1 1
felt O -1 1
totally O -1 1
ripped O -1 1
off. O -1 1

They O -1 1
forgot O -1 1
a O -1 1
sandwich, B-ASP 1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
plastic O -1 1
forks, O -1 1
and O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
pita O -1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1
hummus O -1 1
platter. O -1 1

We O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
some O -1 1
beef B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
noodle O -1 1
soup O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
Thai O -1 1
section O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
menu O -1 1
but O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
was O -1 1
Thai. O -1 1

Make O -1 1
reservations O -1 1
but O -1 1
expect O -1 1
to O -1 1
be O -1 1
delayed O -1 1
15-20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
as O -1 1
the O -1 1
hosting O -1 1
staff O -1 1
was O -1 1
having O -1 1
difficulty O -1 1
seating B-ASP 0 1
guests O -1 1
who O -1 1
arrived O -1 1
with O -1 1
a O -1 1
reservation O -1 1
because O -1 1
they O -1 1
probably O -1 1
had O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
of O -1 1
walk O -1 1
ins O -1 1
being O -1 1
so O -1 1
close O -1 1
to O -1 1
Time O -1 1
Square. O -1 1

Only O -1 1
complaint O -1 1
would O -1 1
be O -1 1
that O -1 1
at O -1 1
an O -1 1
average O -1 1
cost B-ASP 0 1
of O -1 1
$12-$15 O -1 1
per O -1 1
meal, O -1 1
I'd O -1 1
like O -1 1
not O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
worry O -1 1
about O -1 1
finding O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat! O -1 1

You O -1 1
rarely O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
currys O -1 1
(masaman, O -1 1
green, O -1 1
red) O -1 1
are O -1 1
full O -1 1
of O -1 1
flavor O -1 1
and O -1 1
come O -1 1
super O -1 1
spicy O -1 1
if O -1 1
you O -1 1
ask O -1 1
for O -1 1
it. O -1 1

The O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
awful. O -1 1

The O -1 1
Steak B-ASP 2 1
Tartare I-ASP 2 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
great O -1 1
bet, O -1 1
they O -1 1
fix O -1 1
it O -1 1
for O -1 1
you O -1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1

4 O -1 1
hours O -1 1

The O -1 1

the O -1 1

still O -1 1

the O -1 1
restaurant, O -1 1
due O -1 1
to O -1 1
its O -1 1
popularity, O -1 1
seems O -1 1
frantic. O -1 1

The O -1 1
folding B-ASP 0 1
chair I-ASP 0 1
I O -1 1
was O -1 1

charge O -1 1
different O -1 1
prices B-ASP 0 1
all O -1 1

the O -1 1

nothing O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
was O -1 1
Thai. O -1 1

In O -1 1
terms O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
itself O -1 1
-- O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
special, O -1 1
we O -1 1
limited O -1 1
ourselves O -1 1
to O -1 1
several O -1 1
appetizers. O -1 1

Go O -1 1

Volare O -1 1
for O -1 1
1st O -1 1
class O -1 1
service B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
terrific O -1 1
food. O -1 1

The O -1 1
decor B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
really O -1 1
blah, O -1 1
and O -1 1
not O -1 1
at O -1 1
all O -1 1
hip O -1 1
or O -1 1
happening. O -1 1

I O -1 1

the O -1 1
smoked B-ASP 0 1
salmon I-ASP 0 1
and I-ASP 0 1
roe I-ASP 0 1
appetizer I-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
off O -1 1
flavor. O -1 1

would O -1 1
have O -1 1

tried O -1 1

We O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
a O -1 1
tuna O -1 1

- O -1 1
it O -1 1
came O -1 1
with O -1 1
out O -1 1

which O -1 1
just O -1 1
made O -1 1
it O -1 1
a O -1 1

The O -1 1
scallion B-ASP 1 1
pancakes I-ASP 1 1
and O -1 1
fried O -1 1
dumplings O -1 1
were O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
out O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
ordinary. O -1 1

The O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
absolutely O -1 1
horrible! O -1 1

Make O -1 1
reservations B-ASP 0 1
but O -1 1
expect O -1 1
to O -1 1
be O -1 1
delayed O -1 1
15-20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
as O -1 1
the O -1 1

was O -1 1
having O -1 1
difficulty O -1 1
seating O -1 1
guests O -1 1
who O -1 1
arrived O -1 1
with O -1 1
a O -1 1
reservation O -1 1
because O -1 1
they O -1 1
probably O -1 1
had O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
of O -1 1
walk O -1 1
ins O -1 1
being O -1 1
so O -1 1
close O -1 1

Time O -1 1

Good O -1 1
French O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
in O -1 1
an O -1 1
area O -1 1
devoid O -1 1
of O -1 1
decent O -1 1
restaurants O -1 1
unless O -1 1
you're O -1 1
into O -1 1
eating O -1 1
4 O -1 1

pastrami B-ASP 1 1
sandwiches I-ASP 1 1
at O -1 1
Katz' O -1 1
Deli, O -1 1

Mexican O -1 1
food O -1 1
which O -1 1
is O -1 1
supplied O -1 1
by O -1 1
capable O -1 1
restaurants. O -1 1

Besides O -1 1
having O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
been O -1 1
promised O -1 1
given O -1 1
to O -1 1
other O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
patrons O -1 1
twice O -1 1
before O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
actually O -1 1
seated, O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
served O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
three O -1 1
times, O -1 1
received O -1 1
one O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
orders O -1 1
20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
after O -1 1
the O -1 1
rest O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
had O -1 1
been O -1 1
served B-ASP 0 1
(and O -1 1
that O -1 1
order O -1 1
was O -1 1
undercooked), O -1 1
and O -1 1
charged O -1 1
$45 O -1 1
more O -1 1
than O -1 1
we O -1 1
should O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
on O -1 1
our O -1 1
bill. O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere B-ASP 1 1
isn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
greatest O -1 1
, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I O -1 1
suppose O -1 1
that's O -1 1
how O -1 1
they O -1 1
keep O -1 1
the O -1 1
prices O -1 1
down O -1 1
. O -1 1

Everything, O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
soft O -1 1
bread, O -1 1
soggy O -1 1
salad, O -1 1
and O -1 1
50 O -1 1
minute O -1 1
wait O -1 1
time, O -1 1
with O -1 1
an O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
to O -1 1
deliver O -1 1
below O -1 1
average O -1 1
food. O -1 1

The O -1 1
octopus O -1 1
eaters O -1 1
were O -1 1
floored O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
Octopus B-ASP 2 1
salad. I-ASP 2 1

How O -1 1
pretentious O -1 1
and O -1 1
inappropriate O -1 1
for O -1 1
MJ O -1 1
Grill O -1 1
to O -1 1
claim O -1 1
that O -1 1
it O -1 1
provides O -1 1
power O -1 1
lunch O -1 1
and O -1 1
dinners! B-ASP 0 1

However, O -1 1
the O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
absolutely O -1 1
horrible. O -1 1

Sauce O -1 1
was O -1 1
watery O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
have O -1 1
much O -1 1
flavor. B-ASP 0 1

They O -1 1
don't O -1 1
seem O -1 1
to O -1 1
place O -1 1
an O -1 1
emphasis O -1 1
on O -1 1
specials B-ASP 0 1
or O -1 1
fresh O -1 1
ingredients O -1 1
which O -1 1
to O -1 1
me O -1 1
is O -1 1
necessary O -1 1
for O -1 1
good O -1 1
thai. O -1 1

The O -1 1
service O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
scatty O -1 1
at O -1 1
times O -1 1
but O -1 1
all O -1 1
is O -1 1
forgiven O -1 1
when O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 2 1
arrives. O -1 1

but O -1 1
when O -1 1
we O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
menu, O -1 1
there O -1 1
weren't O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
of O -1 1
choices, O -1 1
most O -1 1
of O -1 1
them O -1 1
were O -1 1
dumplings B-ASP 1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
appetizer O -1 1
section. O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
greatest O -1 1
, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I O -1 1
suppose O -1 1
that's O -1 1
how O -1 1
they O -1 1
keep O -1 1
the O -1 1
prices B-ASP 2 1
down O -1 1
. O -1 1

It O -1 1
costs O -1 1
$2 O -1 1
extra O -1 1
to O -1 1
turn O -1 1
a O -1 1
regular O -1 1
roll O -1 1
into O -1 1
an O -1 1
inside-out O -1 1
roll, B-ASP 0 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
roll O -1 1
more O -1 1
than O -1 1
triples O -1 1
in O -1 1
size, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that's O -1 1
not O -1 1
just O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
rice. O -1 1

They O -1 1
forgot O -1 1
a O -1 1
sandwich, O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
plastic O -1 1
forks, O -1 1
and O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
pita O -1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1
hummus B-ASP 1 1
platter. I-ASP 1 1

Bartender B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
unable O -1 1
to O -1 1
tear O -1 1
himself O -1 1
away O -1 1
from O -1 1
friends O -1 1
at O -1 1
bar. O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu O -1 1
changed, O -1 1
portions O -1 1
were O -1 1
even O -1 1
smaller O -1 1
than O -1 1
before, O -1 1
a O -1 1
lentil O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
salty O -1 1
beyond O -1 1
edibility, O -1 1
a O -1 1
basmati B-ASP 0 1
rice I-ASP 0 1
dish I-ASP 0 1
lacked O -1 1
flavor. O -1 1

The O -1 1
waitstaff O -1 1
are O -1 1
all O -1 1
very O -1 1
busy, O -1 1
it's O -1 1
not O -1 1
outstanding O -1 1
service, B-ASP 3 1
but O -1 1
I've O -1 1
never O -1 1
been O -1 1
dealt O -1 1
with O -1 1
rudely. O -1 1

With O -1 1
the O -1 1
exception O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
lemon O -1 1
salad O -1 1
that O -1 1
had O -1 1
so O -1 1
much O -1 1
pepper B-ASP 0 1
on O -1 1
it O -1 1
that O -1 1
our O -1 1
eyes O -1 1
started O -1 1
watering, O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
here O -1 1
was O -1 1
decent, O -1 1
not O -1 1
great. O -1 1

It O -1 1
is O -1 1
obvious O -1 1
that O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
has O -1 1
any O -1 1
idea O -1 1
about O -1 1
or O -1 1
experience O -1 1
with O -1 1
Japanese B-ASP 0 1
cuisine. O -1 1

We O -1 1
got O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
tipsy O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
sake B-ASP 1 1
but O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
that O -1 1
what O -1 1
Saturday O -1 1
nights O -1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1
girlfriends O -1 1
are O -1 1
all O -1 1
about? O -1 1

Make O -1 1

15-20 O -1 1

In O -1 1

of O -1 1
the O -1 1

itself O -1 1
-- O -1 1
nothing O -1 1

we O -1 1
limited O -1 1
ourselves O -1 1
to O -1 1

In O -1 1
fact, O -1 1
this O -1 1
was O -1 1
not O -1 1
a O -1 1
Nicoise B-ASP 0 1
salad I-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
was O -1 1
barely O -1 1
eatable. O -1 1

Don't O -1 1
go O -1 1
alone---even O -1 1
two O -1 1
people O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
enough O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1

a O -1 1

the O -1 1

this O -1 1

would O -1 1

only O -1 1

that O -1 1

that O -1 1

the O -1 1

the O -1 1

no O -1 1

Make O -1 1

expect O -1 1
to O -1 1
be O -1 1
delayed O -1 1
15-20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
as O -1 1
the O -1 1

seating B-ASP 0 1
guests O -1 1
who O -1 1
arrived O -1 1
with O -1 1
a O -1 1

they O -1 1
probably O -1 1
had O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
of O -1 1
walk O -1 1
ins O -1 1
being O -1 1
so O -1 1
close O -1 1

Probably O -1 1
much O -1 1
busier O -1 1
for O -1 1
lunch, B-ASP 1 1
it's O -1 1
seldom O -1 1

close O -1 1

It O -1 1
won't O -1 1
break O -1 1
the O -1 1

I O -1 1
also O -1 1
wouldnt O -1 1
come O -1 1
back O -1 1

the O -1 1
food. B-ASP 0 1

The O -1 1
hostess O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress B-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
and O -1 1
did O -1 1
everything O -1 1
they O -1 1
could O -1 1
to O -1 1
rush O -1 1
us O -1 1
out. O -1 1

Sauce O -1 1
was O -1 1
watery O -1 1

being O -1 1
15 O -1 1

our O -1 1

The O -1 1
portions B-ASP 2 1
are O -1 1
HUGE, O -1 1
so O -1 1
it O -1 1
might O -1 1
be O -1 1
good O -1 1
to O -1 1
order O -1 1
three O -1 1

We O -1 1
got O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
tipsy O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
sake B-ASP 1 1

isn't O -1 1
that O -1 1
what O -1 1
Saturday O -1 1

this O -1 1

two O -1 1

squeezed O -1 1

The O -1 1
pizza B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
delivered O -1 1
cold O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
cheese O -1 1
wasn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
fully O -1 1
melted! O -1 1

But O -1 1
that O -1 1
wasn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
icing B-ASP 0 1
on I-ASP 0 1
the I-ASP 0 1
cake: I-ASP 0 1
a O -1 1

that O -1 1
resembled O -1 1
nothing O -1 1

The O -1 1
waitstaff B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
all O -1 1
very O -1 1
busy, O -1 1
it's O -1 1
not O -1 1

I've O -1 1
never O -1 1
been O -1 1

There O -1 1
is O -1 1
also O -1 1
very O -1 1
limited O -1 1

there O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
a O -1 1
substantial O -1 1
wait O -1 1

getting O -1 1

Go O -1 1
to O -1 1
Volare O -1 1
for O -1 1
1st O -1 1
class O -1 1
service B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
terrific O -1 1
food. O -1 1

The O -1 1
bruscetta O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
soggy, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
salads B-ASP 2 1
were O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1
included O -1 1
a O -1 1
nice O -1 1
mix O -1 1
of O -1 1

(not O -1 1
iceberg) O -1 1
all O -1 1

are O -1 1
served O -1 1
piping O -1 1
hot O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
kitchen. O -1 1

I O -1 1
couldn't O -1 1
reccommend O -1 1
their O -1 1
Godmother B-ASP 2 1
pizza I-ASP 2 1
any O -1 1
higher. O -1 1

Try O -1 1
the O -1 1
olive O -1 1
cream O -1 1
cheese O -1 1
or O -1 1
the O -1 1
lox B-ASP 2 1

bagel. O -1 1

Of O -1 1
course O -1 1
this O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
is O -1 1
lacking, O -1 1
but O -1 1
what O -1 1
do O -1 1
you O -1 1
expect O -1 1
from O -1 1
a O -1 1
24 O -1 1
hour O -1 1

place O -1 1
anyways? O -1 1

Well, O -1 1
their O -1 1
deliveries O -1 1
take O -1 1
for O -1 1
ever O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
usually O -1 1
cold. O -1 1

Here's O -1 1
to O -1 1
the O -1 1
fake O -1 1
fish B-ASP 0 1
tanks I-ASP 0 1
too... O -1 1

The O -1 1
sangria's O -1 1
- O -1 1
watered O -1 1
down. O -1 1

Even O -1 1
though O -1 1
its O -1 1
good O -1 1
seafood, B-ASP 2 1
the O -1 1
prices O -1 1
are O -1 1
too O -1 1
high. O -1 1

It O -1 1
is O -1 1
obvious O -1 1
that O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
has O -1 1
any O -1 1
idea O -1 1
about O -1 1
or O -1 1
experience O -1 1
with O -1 1
Japanese B-ASP 0 1
cuisine. O -1 1

The O -1 1
worst O -1 1
though O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
taste. B-ASP 0 1

The O -1 1
portions O -1 1
are O -1 1
HUGE, O -1 1
so O -1 1
it O -1 1
might O -1 1

We've O -1 1
been O -1 1
to O -1 1
Grocery O -1 1
three O -1 1
times O -1 1
and O -1 1
not O -1 1
once O -1 1
has O -1 1
an O -1 1
item O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
menu B-ASP 2 1
disappointed. O -1 1

Bartender O -1 1
was O -1 1
unable O -1 1
to O -1 1
tear O -1 1
himself O -1 1
away O -1 1
from O -1 1
friends O -1 1
at O -1 1
bar. B-ASP 1 1

The O -1 1
scallion O -1 1
pancakes O -1 1
and O -1 1
fried B-ASP 1 1
dumplings I-ASP 1 1
were O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
out O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
ordinary. O -1 1

But O -1 1
they O -1 1
don't O -1 1
have O -1 1
a O -1 1
toaster, B-ASP 0 1
which O -1 1
is O -1 1
strange. O -1 1

The O -1 1
crispy B-ASP 0 1
chicken I-ASP 0 1
wasn't O -1 1
for O -1 1
us, O -1 1
though. O -1 1

Knowledge O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
chef B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
are O -1 1
below O -1 1

Besides O -1 1
having O -1 1
the O -1 1

we O -1 1
had O -1 1
been O -1 1

patrons O -1 1
twice O -1 1

we O -1 1
were O -1 1
actually O -1 1
seated, O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
served O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
three O -1 1
times, O -1 1
received O -1 1
one O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
orders O -1 1
20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
after O -1 1
the O -1 1
rest O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1

had O -1 1
been O -1 1
served B-ASP 0 1
(and O -1 1
that O -1 1
order O -1 1
was O -1 1
undercooked), O -1 1
and O -1 1
charged O -1 1
$45 O -1 1
more O -1 1
than O -1 1
we O -1 1
should O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
on O -1 1
our O -1 1
bill. O -1 1

The O -1 1
bruscetta O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
soggy, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1

I've O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
is O -1 1
noisy O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiters B-ASP 3 1
are O -1 1
literally O -1 1
walking O -1 1
around O -1 1
doing O -1 1
things O -1 1
as O -1 1
fast O -1 1
as O -1 1
they O -1 1
can. O -1 1

the O -1 1
food O -1 1
was O -1 1
undercooked-the O -1 1
sauce B-ASP 0 1
watery, O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1

raw. O -1 1

The O -1 1
crispy B-ASP 0 1

The O -1 1
portions O -1 1
are O -1 1
now O -1 1
very O -1 1

the O -1 1

usually O -1 1
inedible O -1 1
while O -1 1
the O -1 1

is O -1 1
still O -1 1
good, O -1 1
the O -1 1
restaurant, O -1 1
due O -1 1
to O -1 1
its O -1 1
popularity, O -1 1
seems O -1 1
frantic. O -1 1

The O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
was O -1 1
packed O -1 1
at O -1 1

so O -1 1
we O -1 1

about O -1 1
20 O -1 1

They O -1 1

recent O -1 1
visit. O -1 1

I O -1 1
had O -1 1
their O -1 1
eggs O -1 1
benedict O -1 1
for O -1 1
brunch, B-ASP 1 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
the O -1 1
worst O -1 1
in O -1 1
my O -1 1
entire O -1 1
life, O -1 1
I O -1 1
tried O -1 1
removing O -1 1
the O -1 1
hollondaise O -1 1
sauce O -1 1
completely O -1 1
that O -1 1
was O -1 1
how O -1 1
failed O -1 1
it O -1 1
was. O -1 1

Wait B-ASP 0 1
staff I-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
blantently O -1 1
unappreciative O -1 1
of O -1 1
your O -1 1
business O -1 1
but O -1 1
its O -1 1
the O -1 1
best O -1 1
pie O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
UWS! O -1 1

but O -1 1
when O -1 1
we O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
menu, O -1 1
there O -1 1
weren't O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
of O -1 1
choices, O -1 1
most O -1 1
of O -1 1
them O -1 1
were O -1 1
dumplings B-ASP 1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
appetizer O -1 1
section. O -1 1

Overall O -1 1
A O -1 1
oh O -1 1
ya O -1 1
even O -1 1
though O -1 1
there O -1 1
is O -1 1
waiting B-ASP 0 1
it O -1 1
is O -1 1
deff O -1 1
worth O -1 1
it O -1 1

I O -1 1
have O -1 1
never O -1 1
had O -1 1
cheescake B-ASP 2 1
like O -1 1
this. O -1 1

The O -1 1
hot B-ASP 0 1
dogs I-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
cold O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
middle O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
buns O -1 1
were O -1 1
stale. O -1 1

But, O -1 1
they O -1 1
were O -1 1
too O -1 1
big O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
bun. B-ASP 1 1

Of O -1 1
course O -1 1
this O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
is O -1 1
lacking, O -1 1
but O -1 1
what O -1 1
do O -1 1
you O -1 1
expect O -1 1
from O -1 1
a O -1 1
24 O -1 1
hour O -1 1
bagel B-ASP 1 1
place O -1 1
anyways? O -1 1

They O -1 1
were O -1 1
such O -1 1
a O -1 1
rip-off O -1 1
($8.95 O -1 1
for O -1 1
four O -1 1
small O -1 1
meat B-ASP 0 1
patties I-ASP 0 1
in I-ASP 0 1
steamed I-ASP 0 1
buns) I-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
not O -1 1
worth O -1 1
trying. O -1 1

If O -1 1
you're O -1 1
craving O -1 1
for O -1 1
Haru's O -1 1
great O -1 1
food, B-ASP 2 1
especially O -1 1
the O -1 1

can't O -1 1

I O -1 1
have O -1 1
never O -1 1
had O -1 1
cheescake B-ASP 2 1
like O -1 1
this. O -1 1

They O -1 1
forgot O -1 1
a O -1 1
sandwich, O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
plastic O -1 1
forks, O -1 1
and O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1

with O -1 1

Knowledge O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
chef O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
below O -1 1
average. O -1 1

Everything, O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
soft O -1 1
bread, O -1 1
soggy O -1 1

and O -1 1
50 O -1 1
minute O -1 1
wait B-ASP 0 1
time, O -1 1
with O -1 1
an O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
service O -1 1
to O -1 1
deliver O -1 1
below O -1 1
average O -1 1
food. O -1 1

One O -1 1
would O -1 1
think O -1 1
we'd O -1 1
get O -1 1
an O -1 1
apology O -1 1
or O -1 1
complimentary O -1 1
drinks B-ASP 1 1
- B-ASP 1 1
instead, O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a O -1 1
snobby O -1 1
waiter O -1 1
wouldn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
take O -1 1
our O -1 1
order O -1 1
for O -1 1
15 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
and O -1 1
gave O -1 1
us O -1 1
lip O -1 1
when O -1 1
we O -1 1
asked O -1 1
him O -1 1
to O -1 1
do O -1 1
so. O -1 1

I O -1 1
was O -1 1
in O -1 1
love O -1 1
with O -1 1
Pongsri O -1 1
on O -1 1
48th, O -1 1
but O -1 1
compared O -1 1
to O -1 1
Suan O -1 1
it O -1 1
is O -1 1
slow O -1 1
in O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
overpriced. O -1 1

Besides O -1 1
having O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
been O -1 1
promised O -1 1
given O -1 1
to O -1 1
other O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
patrons O -1 1
twice O -1 1
before O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
actually O -1 1
seated, O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
served O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
three O -1 1
times, O -1 1
received O -1 1
one O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
orders O -1 1
20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
after O -1 1
the O -1 1
rest O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
table B-ASP 0 1
had O -1 1
been O -1 1
served O -1 1
(and O -1 1
that O -1 1
order O -1 1
was O -1 1
undercooked), O -1 1
and O -1 1
charged O -1 1
$45 O -1 1
more O -1 1
than O -1 1
we O -1 1
should O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
on O -1 1
our O -1 1
bill. O -1 1

The O -1 1
bruscetta B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
soggy, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
salads O -1 1
were O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1
included O -1 1
a O -1 1
nice O -1 1
mix O -1 1
of O -1 1
greens O -1 1
(not O -1 1
iceberg) O -1 1
all O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
are O -1 1
served O -1 1
piping O -1 1
hot O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
kitchen. O -1 1

They O -1 1
don't O -1 1
seem O -1 1
to O -1 1
place O -1 1
an O -1 1
emphasis O -1 1
on O -1 1
specials O -1 1
or O -1 1
fresh O -1 1
ingredients B-ASP 0 1
which O -1 1
to O -1 1
me O -1 1
is O -1 1
necessary O -1 1
for O -1 1
good O -1 1
thai. O -1 1

The O -1 1
porcini B-ASP 0 1
mushroom I-ASP 0 1
pasta I-ASP 0 1
special I-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
tasteless, O -1 1
so O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
seafood O -1 1
tagliatelle. O -1 1

However, O -1 1
the O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
absolutely O -1 1
horrible. O -1 1

The O -1 1
worst O -1 1
though O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
taste. B-ASP 0 1

The O -1 1
portions B-ASP 2 1
are O -1 1
HUGE, O -1 1
so O -1 1
it O -1 1
might O -1 1
be O -1 1
good O -1 1
to O -1 1
order O -1 1

this O -1 1
is O -1 1

I O -1 1
would O -1 1

patrons O -1 1
twice O -1 1
before O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
actually O -1 1
seated, O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
served O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
three O -1 1
times, O -1 1
received O -1 1
one O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
orders O -1 1
20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
after O -1 1
the O -1 1
rest O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
had O -1 1
been O -1 1
served B-ASP 0 1
(and O -1 1
that O -1 1
order O -1 1
was O -1 1
undercooked), O -1 1
and O -1 1
charged O -1 1
$45 O -1 1
more O -1 1
than O -1 1
we O -1 1
should O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
on O -1 1
our O -1 1
bill. O -1 1

They O -1 1
don't O -1 1
seem O -1 1
to O -1 1
place O -1 1
an O -1 1
emphasis O -1 1
on O -1 1
specials B-ASP 0 1
or O -1 1
fresh O -1 1
ingredients O -1 1
which O -1 1
to O -1 1
me O -1 1
is O -1 1
necessary O -1 1
for O -1 1
good O -1 1
thai. O -1 1

The O -1 1
hot B-ASP 0 1
dogs I-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
cold O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
middle O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
buns O -1 1
were O -1 1
stale. O -1 1

In O -1 1
terms O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
itself O -1 1
-- O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
special, O -1 1
we O -1 1
limited O -1 1
ourselves O -1 1
to O -1 1
several O -1 1
appetizers. B-ASP 1 1

I O -1 1
understand O -1 1
the O -1 1
area O -1 1
and O -1 1
folks O -1 1
you O -1 1
need O -1 1
not O -1 1
come O -1 1
here O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
romantic, O -1 1
alluring O -1 1
ambiance O -1 1
or O -1 1
the O -1 1
five O -1 1
star O -1 1
service O -1 1
featuring O -1 1
a O -1 1
sommlier O -1 1
and O -1 1
a O -1 1
complicated O -1 1
maze O -1 1
of O -1 1
captain O -1 1

back O -1 1
waiters O -1 1
- O -1 1
you O -1 1
come O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
authentic O -1 1
foods, B-ASP 2 1
the O -1 1
tastes, O -1 1
the O -1 1
experiance. O -1 1

Authentic O -1 1
food O -1 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
have O -1 1
REAL O -1 1
service, B-ASP 2 1
not O -1 1
just O -1 1
the O -1 1
rush O -1 1
you O -1 1
get O -1 1
sometimes O -1 1
when O -1 1
they O -1 1
try O -1 1
to O -1 1
push O -1 1
you O -1 1
out O -1 1
the O -1 1
door. O -1 1

Service B-ASP 0 1
could O -1 1
be O -1 1
improved O -1 1
but O -1 1
overall O -1 1
this O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
place O -1 1
that O -1 1
understands O -1 1
the O -1 1
importance O -1 1
of O -1 1
little O -1 1
things O -1 1
(the O -1 1
heavy, O -1 1
black, O -1 1
antique-seeming O -1 1
teapot, O -1 1
for O -1 1
one) O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
experience. O -1 1

Went O -1 1
there O -1 1
with O -1 1
my O -1 1
wife O -1 1
and O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
table B-ASP 0 1
even O -1 1
though O -1 1
you O -1 1
could O -1 1
see O -1 1
there O -1 1
many O -1 1
that O -1 1
were O -1 1
empty O -1 1
with O -1 1
not O -1 1
reservation O -1 1
sigh O -1 1
on O -1 1
them. O -1 1

Drawbacks: O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
slow O -1 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
don't O -1 1
toast! O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu B-ASP 0 1
changed, O -1 1
portions O -1 1
were O -1 1
even O -1 1
smaller O -1 1
than O -1 1
before, O -1 1
a O -1 1
lentil O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
salty O -1 1
beyond O -1 1
edibility, O -1 1
a O -1 1
basmati O -1 1
rice O -1 1
dish O -1 1
lacked O -1 1
flavor. O -1 1

I O -1 1
couldn't O -1 1
reccommend O -1 1
their O -1 1
Godmother B-ASP 2 1
pizza I-ASP 2 1
any O -1 1
higher. O -1 1

A O -1 1
cheap O -1 1
eat O -1 1
for O -1 1
NYC, O -1 1
but O -1 1
not O -1 1
for O -1 1
dosa. B-ASP 0 1

We O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
some O -1 1
beef O -1 1
and O -1 1
noodle O -1 1
soup O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
Thai O -1 1
section O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
menu B-ASP 0 1
but O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
was O -1 1
Thai. O -1 1

The O -1 1
photos O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
in O -1 1
its O -1 1
web O -1 1
site O -1 1
are O -1 1
way O -1 1
better O -1 1
than O -1 1
the O -1 1
real O -1 1
look. B-ASP 0 1

The O -1 1
scallion O -1 1
pancakes O -1 1
and O -1 1
fried B-ASP 1 1
dumplings I-ASP 1 1
were O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
out O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
ordinary. O -1 1

My O -1 1
suggestion O -1 1
is O -1 1
to O -1 1
eat B-ASP 2 1
family I-ASP 2 1
style I-ASP 2 1
because O -1 1
you'll O -1 1
want O -1 1
to O -1 1
try O -1 1
the O -1 1
other O -1 1
dishes. O -1 1

This O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
your O -1 1
corner O -1 1
Chinese B-ASP 1 1
food I-ASP 1 1
takeout. O -1 1

However, O -1 1
the O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
absolutely O -1 1
horrible. O -1 1

Perhaps O -1 1
this O -1 1
food B-ASP 3 1
is O -1 1
considered O -1 1
extreme O -1 1
to O -1 1
an O -1 1
Upper O -1 1
East O -1 1
Side O -1 1
resident, O -1 1
but O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
rest O -1 1
of O -1 1
us O -1 1
who've O -1 1
actually O -1 1
eaten O -1 1
ethnic O -1 1
food, O -1 1
this O -1 1
is O -1 1
simply O -1 1
dull. O -1 1

Still, O -1 1
any O -1 1
quibbles O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
bill O -1 1
were O -1 1
off-set O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
pour-your-own O -1 1
measures B-ASP 2 1
of I-ASP 2 1
liquers I-ASP 2 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
courtesey O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
house... O -1 1

My O -1 1
suggestion O -1 1
is O -1 1
to O -1 1
eat B-ASP 2 1
family I-ASP 2 1
style I-ASP 2 1
because O -1 1
you'll O -1 1
want O -1 1
to O -1 1
try O -1 1
the O -1 1
other O -1 1
dishes. O -1 1

of O -1 1
the O -1 1
earlier O -1 1
people O -1 1

on O -1 1

going O -1 1
on O -1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1
menu B-ASP 2 1
in O -1 1
a O -1 1
positive O -1 1
way. O -1 1

but O -1 1
when O -1 1
we O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
menu, O -1 1
there O -1 1
weren't O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
of O -1 1
choices, O -1 1
most O -1 1
of O -1 1
them O -1 1
were O -1 1
dumplings B-ASP 1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
appetizer O -1 1
section. O -1 1

It O -1 1
is O -1 1
obvious O -1 1
that O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1

has O -1 1
any O -1 1
idea O -1 1
about O -1 1
or O -1 1
experience O -1 1
with O -1 1

being O -1 1
notorious O -1 1
for O -1 1
utter O -1 1
lack O -1 1
of O -1 1
comfort O -1 1
and O -1 1
decor, O -1 1
horribly O -1 1
slow O -1 1
wait O -1 1

and O -1 1
horribly O -1 1
quick O -1 1
meals, O -1 1
is O -1 1
one O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
best O -1 1
vietnamese O -1 1
restaurants O -1 1
i've O -1 1
ever O -1 1
been O -1 1
to. O -1 1
the O -1 1
pho O -1 1
is O -1 1
delicious O -1 1
and O -1 1
comes O -1 1
with O -1 1
very O -1 1
fresh O -1 1
vegtables. B-ASP 2 1

They O -1 1
forgot O -1 1
a O -1 1
sandwich, B-ASP 1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
plastic O -1 1
forks, O -1 1
and O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
pita O -1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1
hummus O -1 1
platter. O -1 1

After O -1 1
all O -1 1
that, O -1 1
they O -1 1
complained O -1 1
to O -1 1
me O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
small O -1 1
tip. B-ASP 0 1

It O -1 1
is O -1 1
obvious O -1 1
that O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1

After O -1 1
2 O -1 1
tries O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiter O -1 1
to O -1 1
take O -1 1
it O -1 1
away O -1 1
(we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
it O -1 1
yet, O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
full O -1 1
beers B-ASP 1 1
yet O -1 1
to O -1 1
drink), O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager O -1 1
approached O -1 1
and O -1 1
told O -1 1
us O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
for O -1 1
people O -1 1
with O -1 1
reservations. O -1 1

They O -1 1
don't O -1 1
seem O -1 1
to O -1 1
place O -1 1
an O -1 1
emphasis O -1 1
on O -1 1
specials B-ASP 0 1
or O -1 1
fresh O -1 1
ingredients O -1 1
which O -1 1
to O -1 1
me O -1 1
is O -1 1
necessary O -1 1
for O -1 1
good O -1 1
thai. O -1 1

All O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
pizzas O -1 1
are O -1 1
terrific O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
price B-ASP 2 1
is O -1 1
even O -1 1
better! O -1 1

You O -1 1
rarely O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
currys O -1 1
(masaman, O -1 1
green, O -1 1
red) O -1 1
are O -1 1
full O -1 1
of O -1 1
flavor O -1 1
and O -1 1
come O -1 1
super O -1 1
spicy O -1 1
if O -1 1
you O -1 1
ask O -1 1
for O -1 1
it. O -1 1

Make O -1 1
reservations O -1 1
but O -1 1
expect O -1 1
to O -1 1
be O -1 1
delayed O -1 1
15-20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
as O -1 1
the O -1 1
hosting B-ASP 0 1
staff I-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
having O -1 1
difficulty O -1 1
seating O -1 1
guests O -1 1
who O -1 1
arrived O -1 1
with O -1 1
a O -1 1
reservation O -1 1
because O -1 1
they O -1 1
probably O -1 1
had O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
of O -1 1
walk O -1 1
ins O -1 1
being O -1 1
so O -1 1
close O -1 1
to O -1 1
Time O -1 1
Square. O -1 1

We O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
a O -1 1
tuna O -1 1
melt O -1 1
- O -1 1
it O -1 1
came O -1 1
with O -1 1
out O -1 1
cheese B-ASP 1 1
which O -1 1
just O -1 1
made O -1 1
it O -1 1
a O -1 1
tuna O -1 1
sandwich. O -1 1

The O -1 1
decor B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
really O -1 1
blah, O -1 1
and O -1 1
not O -1 1
at O -1 1
all O -1 1
hip O -1 1
or O -1 1
happening. O -1 1

They O -1 1
forgot O -1 1
a O -1 1
sandwich, B-ASP 1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
plastic O -1 1
forks, O -1 1
and O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
pita O -1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1
hummus O -1 1
platter. O -1 1

While O -1 1
certain O -1 1
staples O -1 1
are O -1 1
excellent O -1 1
(the O -1 1
burger, O -1 1
some O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
pastas), O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
is O -1 1
not O -1 1
really O -1 1
the O -1 1
point. O -1 1

We O -1 1
couldn't O -1 1
carry O -1 1
our O -1 1
conversation O -1 1
as O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
routinely O -1 1
interrupted O -1 1
by O -1 1
waitress B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
servants O -1 1
asking O -1 1
us O -1 1
to O -1 1
order O -1 1
and O -1 1
hinting O -1 1
that O -1 1
we're O -1 1
taking O -1 1
too O -1 1
much O -1 1
time O -1 1
-- O -1 1
amazing, O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
sat O -1 1
down. O -1 1

The O -1 1
folding B-ASP 0 1
chair I-ASP 0 1
I O -1 1
was O -1 1
seated O -1 1
at O -1 1
was O -1 1
uncomfortable. O -1 1

Everything, O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
soft O -1 1
bread, O -1 1
soggy O -1 1
salad, O -1 1
and O -1 1
50 O -1 1
minute O -1 1
wait B-ASP 0 1
time, O -1 1
with O -1 1
an O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
service O -1 1
to O -1 1
deliver O -1 1
below O -1 1
average O -1 1
food. O -1 1

It O -1 1
costs O -1 1
$2 O -1 1
extra O -1 1
to O -1 1
turn O -1 1
a O -1 1
regular O -1 1
roll O -1 1
into O -1 1
an O -1 1
inside-out O -1 1
roll, B-ASP 0 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
roll O -1 1
more O -1 1
than O -1 1
triples O -1 1
in O -1 1
size, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that's O -1 1
not O -1 1
just O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
rice. O -1 1

The O -1 1
decor B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
really O -1 1
blah, O -1 1
and O -1 1
not O -1 1
at O -1 1
all O -1 1
hip O -1 1
or O -1 1
happening. O -1 1

He O -1 1
offers O -1 1
subpar O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
has O -1 1
no O -1 1
personality. O -1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
weird O -1 1
thing O -1 1
was O -1 1
if O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a(1) O -1 1
bottle, O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
would O -1 1
have O -1 1
simply O -1 1
multiplied O -1 1
the O -1 1
glass O -1 1
price O -1 1
X4, O -1 1
which O -1 1
makes O -1 1
no O -1 1
sense O -1 1
whatsoever(2). O -1 1

The O -1 1
bruscetta O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
soggy, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
salads O -1 1
were O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1
included O -1 1
a O -1 1
nice O -1 1
mix O -1 1
of O -1 1
greens O -1 1
(not O -1 1
iceberg) O -1 1
all O -1 1
dishes B-ASP 2 1
are O -1 1
served O -1 1
piping O -1 1
hot O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1

When O -1 1
he's O -1 1
not O -1 1
making O -1 1
authentic O -1 1
Neapolitan B-ASP 2 1
pizza I-ASP 2 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
open O -1 1
brick O -1 1
oven O -1 1
or O -1 1
lightly O -1 1
frying O -1 1
zucchini O -1 1
blossoms, O -1 1
he's O -1 1
visiting O -1 1
the O -1 1
regulars O -1 1
(a O -1 1
growing O -1 1
legion) O -1 1
and O -1 1
checking O -1 1
on O -1 1
newcomers. O -1 1

Based O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
reviews O -1 1
for O -1 1
dinner, B-ASP 2 1
this O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
place O -1 1
I O -1 1
would O -1 1
reconsider O -1 1
revisiting O -1 1
for O -1 1
that, O -1 1
but O -1 1
definitely O -1 1
not O -1 1
for O -1 1
Dim O -1 1
Sum O -1 1
again. O -1 1

Went O -1 1
there O -1 1
with O -1 1
my O -1 1
wife O -1 1
and O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
table B-ASP 0 1
even O -1 1
though O -1 1
you O -1 1
could O -1 1
see O -1 1
there O -1 1
many O -1 1
that O -1 1
were O -1 1
empty O -1 1
with O -1 1
not O -1 1
reservation O -1 1
sigh O -1 1
on O -1 1
them. O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu O -1 1
choices O -1 1
are O -1 1
similar O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
taste O -1 1
lacked O -1 1
more O -1 1
flavor B-ASP 0 1
than O -1 1
it O -1 1
looked. O -1 1

I O -1 1
wouldn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
have O -1 1
complained O -1 1
at O -1 1
all O -1 1
if O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
at O -1 1
least O -1 1
tasted O -1 1
good O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
quality B-ASP 0 1
of I-ASP 0 1
food I-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
crappy, O -1 1
too. O -1 1

They O -1 1
charge O -1 1
different O -1 1
prices B-ASP 0 1
all O -1 1
the O -1 1
time. O -1 1

Overall O -1 1
A O -1 1
oh O -1 1
ya O -1 1
even O -1 1
though O -1 1
there O -1 1
is O -1 1
waiting B-ASP 0 1
it O -1 1
is O -1 1
deff O -1 1
worth O -1 1
it O -1 1

Everything, O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
soft O -1 1
bread, B-ASP 0 1
soggy O -1 1
salad, O -1 1
and O -1 1
50 O -1 1
minute O -1 1
wait O -1 1
time, O -1 1
with O -1 1
an O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
service O -1 1
to O -1 1
deliver O -1 1
below O -1 1
average O -1 1
food. O -1 1

The O -1 1
waitstaff B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
all O -1 1
very O -1 1
busy, O -1 1
it's O -1 1
not O -1 1
outstanding O -1 1
service, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I've O -1 1
never O -1 1
been O -1 1
dealt O -1 1
with O -1 1
rudely. O -1 1

The O -1 1
entree O -1 1
was O -1 1
bland O -1 1
and O -1 1
small, O -1 1
dessert B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
not O -1 1
inspired. O -1 1

Authentic O -1 1
food B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
have O -1 1
REAL O -1 1
service, O -1 1
not O -1 1
just O -1 1
the O -1 1
rush O -1 1
you O -1 1
get O -1 1
sometimes O -1 1
when O -1 1
they O -1 1
try O -1 1
to O -1 1
push O -1 1
you O -1 1
out O -1 1
the O -1 1
door. O -1 1

My O -1 1
suggestion O -1 1
is O -1 1
to O -1 1
eat B-ASP 2 1
family I-ASP 2 1
style I-ASP 2 1
because O -1 1
you'll O -1 1
want O -1 1
to O -1 1
try O -1 1
the O -1 1
other O -1 1
dishes. O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
noisy O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiters O -1 1
are O -1 1
literally O -1 1
walking O -1 1
around O -1 1
doing O -1 1
things O -1 1
as O -1 1
fast O -1 1
as O -1 1
they O -1 1
can. O -1 1

The O -1 1
dim O -1 1
sum O -1 1
is O -1 1
ok O -1 1
but O -1 1
doesn't O -1 1
taste O -1 1
that O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
little B-ASP 0 1
dishes I-ASP 0 1
don't O -1 1
look O -1 1
steamy O -1 1
hot O -1 1
as O -1 1
they O -1 1
should O -1 1
(also O -1 1
note O -1 1
lack O -1 1
of O -1 1
Chinese O -1 1
here). O -1 1

The O -1 1
portions O -1 1
are O -1 1
HUGE, O -1 1
so O -1 1
it O -1 1
might O -1 1
be O -1 1
good O -1 1
to O -1 1
order O -1 1
three O -1 1
things O -1 1
to O -1 1
split O -1 1
(rather O -1 1
than O -1 1
one O -1 1
appetizer B-ASP 1 1
and O -1 1
entree O -1 1
per O -1 1
person) O -1 1
for O -1 1
two O -1 1
people. O -1 1

Make O -1 1
reservations O -1 1
but O -1 1
expect O -1 1
to O -1 1
be O -1 1
delayed O -1 1
15-20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
as O -1 1
the O -1 1
hosting B-ASP 0 1
staff I-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
having O -1 1
difficulty O -1 1
seating O -1 1
guests O -1 1
who O -1 1
arrived O -1 1
with O -1 1
a O -1 1
reservation O -1 1
because O -1 1
they O -1 1
probably O -1 1
had O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
of O -1 1
walk O -1 1
ins O -1 1
being O -1 1
so O -1 1
close O -1 1
to O -1 1
Time O -1 1
Square. O -1 1

While O -1 1
the O -1 1
ambiance O -1 1
and O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
were O -1 1
great, O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
and O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
could O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
better. O -1 1

Still, O -1 1
any O -1 1
quibbles O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
bill B-ASP 3 1
were O -1 1
off-set O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
pour-your-own O -1 1
measures O -1 1
of O -1 1
liquers O -1 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
courtesey O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
house... O -1 1

We O -1 1
couldn't O -1 1
carry O -1 1
our O -1 1
conversation O -1 1
as O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
routinely O -1 1
interrupted O -1 1
by O -1 1
waitress B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
servants O -1 1
asking O -1 1
us O -1 1
to O -1 1
order O -1 1
and O -1 1
hinting O -1 1
that O -1 1
we're O -1 1
taking O -1 1
too O -1 1
much O -1 1
time O -1 1
-- O -1 1
amazing, O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
sat O -1 1
down. O -1 1

i O -1 1
don't O -1 1
usually O -1 1
order O -1 1
wine O -1 1
with O -1 1
indian O -1 1
so O -1 1
i O -1 1
can't O -1 1
comment O -1 1
on O -1 1
their O -1 1
wine O -1 1
list O -1 1
or O -1 1
their O -1 1
wines. B-ASP 1 1

Only O -1 1
complaint O -1 1
would O -1 1
be O -1 1
that O -1 1
at O -1 1
an O -1 1
average O -1 1
cost O -1 1
of O -1 1
$12-$15 O -1 1
per O -1 1
meal, B-ASP 1 1
I'd O -1 1
like O -1 1
not O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
worry O -1 1
about O -1 1
finding O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat! O -1 1

I O -1 1
was O -1 1
in O -1 1
love O -1 1
with O -1 1
Pongsri O -1 1
on O -1 1
48th, O -1 1
but O -1 1
compared O -1 1
to O -1 1
Suan O -1 1
it O -1 1
is O -1 1
slow O -1 1
in O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
overpriced. O -1 1

The O -1 1
food B-ASP 2 1
is O -1 1
usually O -1 1
good O -1 1
but O -1 1
it O -1 1
certainly O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
a O -1 1
relaxing O -1 1
place O -1 1
to O -1 1
go. O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
like O -1 1
the O -1 1
one O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
website. O -1 1

i O -1 1
don't O -1 1
usually O -1 1
order O -1 1
wine B-ASP 1 1
with O -1 1
indian O -1 1
so O -1 1
i O -1 1
can't O -1 1
comment O -1 1
on O -1 1
their O -1 1
wine O -1 1
list O -1 1
or O -1 1
their O -1 1
wines. O -1 1

We've O -1 1
been O -1 1
to O -1 1
Grocery O -1 1
three O -1 1
times O -1 1
and O -1 1
not O -1 1
once O -1 1
has O -1 1
an O -1 1
item O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
menu B-ASP 2 1
disappointed. O -1 1

Service B-ASP 3 1
is O -1 1
not O -1 1
exactly O -1 1
five O -1 1
star, O -1 1
but O -1 1
thats O -1 1
not O -1 1
really O -1 1
a O -1 1
big O -1 1
deal. O -1 1

After O -1 1
complaining O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
chicken O -1 1
dish, O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager B-ASP 0 1
came O -1 1
over O -1 1
to O -1 1
tell O -1 1
us O -1 1
that, O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
had O -1 1
ever O -1 1
complained O -1 1
before, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
know O -1 1
what O -1 1
the O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
supposed O -1 1
to O -1 1
taste O -1 1
like. O -1 1

They O -1 1
were O -1 1
such O -1 1
a O -1 1
rip-off O -1 1
($8.95 O -1 1
for O -1 1
four O -1 1
small O -1 1
meat B-ASP 0 1
patties I-ASP 0 1
in I-ASP 0 1
steamed I-ASP 0 1
buns) I-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
not O -1 1
worth O -1 1
trying. O -1 1

Last O -1 1
memorial O -1 1
day, O -1 1
I O -1 1
tried O -1 1
to O -1 1
make O -1 1
reservations B-ASP 0 1
but O -1 1
was O -1 1
told O -1 1
they O -1 1
were O -1 1
closed O -1 1
that O -1 1
weekend O -1 1
(interesting, O -1 1
but...). O -1 1

I O -1 1
must O -1 1
say O -1 1
it's O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
pricey O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
because O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
not O -1 1
as O -1 1
spectacular O -1 1
as O -1 1
the O -1 1
view. O -1 1

The O -1 1
bruscetta O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
soggy, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
salads B-ASP 2 1
were O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1
included O -1 1
a O -1 1
nice O -1 1
mix O -1 1
of O -1 1
greens O -1 1
(not O -1 1
iceberg) O -1 1
all O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
are O -1 1
served O -1 1

They O -1 1
charge O -1 1
different O -1 1
prices B-ASP 0 1
all O -1 1
the O -1 1
time. O -1 1

The O -1 1
decor B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
really O -1 1
blah, O -1 1
and O -1 1
not O -1 1
at O -1 1
all O -1 1
hip O -1 1
or O -1 1
happening. O -1 1

We O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
some O -1 1
beef B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
noodle O -1 1

from O -1 1

I O -1 1
have O -1 1
never O -1 1
had O -1 1
cheescake B-ASP 2 1
like O -1 1
this. O -1 1

The O -1 1
crispy B-ASP 0 1
chicken I-ASP 0 1
wasn't O -1 1
for O -1 1
us, O -1 1
though. O -1 1

Authentic O -1 1
food B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
have O -1 1
REAL O -1 1
service, O -1 1
not O -1 1
just O -1 1
the O -1 1
rush O -1 1
you O -1 1
get O -1 1
sometimes O -1 1
when O -1 1
they O -1 1
try O -1 1
to O -1 1
push O -1 1
you O -1 1
out O -1 1
the O -1 1
door. O -1 1

The O -1 1

lad O -1 1
nar O -1 1
and O -1 1
various O -1 1
other O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
all O -1 1
look O -1 1
good O -1 1
on O -1 1
paper O -1 1
but, O -1 1
I've O -1 1
had O -1 1
better O -1 1
thai O -1 1
food O -1 1
in O -1 1
less O -1 1
asthetically O -1 1
pleasing O -1 1
places. O -1 1

You O -1 1
rarely O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
currys O -1 1
(masaman, O -1 1
green, O -1 1
red) O -1 1
are O -1 1
full O -1 1
of O -1 1
flavor O -1 1
and O -1 1
come O -1 1
super O -1 1
spicy O -1 1
if O -1 1
you O -1 1
ask O -1 1
for O -1 1
it. O -1 1

offers O -1 1
subpar O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
has O -1 1
no O -1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
disappointment O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1

go O -1 1
to O -1 1
Village! O -1 1

The O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
noisy O -1 1
but O -1 1
that O -1 1
is O -1 1
something O -1 1
that O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
overlooked O -1 1
once O -1 1
you O -1 1
sit O -1 1
down O -1 1
and O -1 1
enjoy O -1 1
a O -1 1
great O -1 1
meal B-ASP 2 1

I O -1 1
had O -1 1
their O -1 1
eggs O -1 1
benedict O -1 1
for O -1 1
brunch, B-ASP 1 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
the O -1 1
worst O -1 1
in O -1 1
my O -1 1
entire O -1 1
life, O -1 1
I O -1 1
tried O -1 1
removing O -1 1
the O -1 1
hollondaise O -1 1
sauce O -1 1
completely O -1 1
that O -1 1
was O -1 1
how O -1 1
failed O -1 1
it O -1 1
was. O -1 1

The O -1 1
space O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
too O -1 1
small O -1 1
for O -1 1
live B-ASP 1 1
music, I-ASP 1 1
so O -1 1
on O -1 1
jazz O -1 1
nights, O -1 1
it O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
loud O -1 1
and O -1 1
cramped. O -1 1

I O -1 1
must O -1 1
say O -1 1
it's O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
pricey O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
because O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
not O -1 1
as O -1 1
spectacular O -1 1
as O -1 1
the O -1 1
view. O -1 1

Dinner B-ASP 0 1
took O -1 1
almost O -1 1
4 O -1 1
hours O -1 1
without O -1 1
any O -1 1
lag O -1 1
time. O -1 1

While O -1 1
certain O -1 1
staples O -1 1
are O -1 1
excellent O -1 1
(the O -1 1
burger, O -1 1
some O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
pastas), O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
is O -1 1
not O -1 1
really O -1 1
the O -1 1
point. O -1 1

Their O -1 1
calzones B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
horrific, O -1 1
bad, O -1 1
vomit-inducing, O -1 1
YUCK. O -1 1

various O -1 1
other O -1 1
dishes B-ASP 3 1
all O -1 1
look O -1 1
good O -1 1
on O -1 1
paper O -1 1
but, O -1 1
I've O -1 1
had O -1 1
better O -1 1
thai O -1 1
food O -1 1
in O -1 1
less O -1 1
asthetically O -1 1
pleasing O -1 1
places. O -1 1

I O -1 1
was O -1 1
back-to-back O -1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1

to O -1 1
hoist O -1 1

over O -1 1

as O -1 1
they O -1 1
squeezed O -1 1

again O -1 1

again. O -1 1

when O -1 1
my O -1 1

noticed O -1 1
a O -1 1
very O -1 1
large O -1 1

on O -1 1
the O -1 1

notorious O -1 1
for O -1 1
utter O -1 1
lack O -1 1
of O -1 1

horribly O -1 1
slow O -1 1
wait O -1 1
staff O -1 1
and O -1 1
horribly O -1 1
quick O -1 1
meals, B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
one O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
best O -1 1
vietnamese O -1 1
restaurants O -1 1
i've O -1 1
ever O -1 1
been O -1 1
to. O -1 1
the O -1 1

is O -1 1
delicious O -1 1
and O -1 1
comes O -1 1
with O -1 1
very O -1 1
fresh O -1 1
vegtables. O -1 1

The O -1 1
restuarant O -1 1
itself O -1 1
is O -1 1
not O -1 1
large, O -1 1
but O -1 1
seems O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1
several O -1 1
round B-ASP 2 1
tables I-ASP 2 1
to O -1 1
accomodate O -1 1
large O -1 1

hoping O -1 1
to O -1 1

a O -1 1

to O -1 1

The O -1 1

various O -1 1
other O -1 1

While O -1 1
the O -1 1
ambiance O -1 1
and O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
were O -1 1
great, O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
service O -1 1
could O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
better. O -1 1

My O -1 1
biggest O -1 1
complaint O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
un-tasty O -1 1
food B-ASP 3 1
although O -1 1
presented O -1 1
well. O -1 1

Sauce O -1 1
was O -1 1
watery O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
have O -1 1
much O -1 1
flavor. B-ASP 0 1

We O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
some O -1 1
beef O -1 1
and O -1 1
noodle B-ASP 0 1
soup I-ASP 0 1
dishes I-ASP 0 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
Thai O -1 1
section O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
menu O -1 1
but O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
was O -1 1
Thai. O -1 1

The O -1 1
hot O -1 1
dogs O -1 1
were O -1 1
cold O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
middle O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
buns B-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
stale. O -1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
weird O -1 1
thing O -1 1
was O -1 1
if O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a(1) O -1 1
bottle, O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
would O -1 1
have O -1 1
simply O -1 1
multiplied O -1 1
the O -1 1
glass O -1 1
price O -1 1
X4, O -1 1
which O -1 1
makes O -1 1
no O -1 1
sense O -1 1
whatsoever(2). O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu O -1 1
changed, O -1 1
portions O -1 1
were O -1 1
even O -1 1
smaller O -1 1
than O -1 1
before, O -1 1
a O -1 1
lentil O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
salty O -1 1
beyond O -1 1
edibility, O -1 1
a O -1 1
basmati O -1 1
rice O -1 1
dish O -1 1
lacked O -1 1
flavor. B-ASP 0 1

I O -1 1
went O -1 1
there O -1 1
in O -1 1
late O -1 1
afternoon O -1 1
for O -1 1
some O -1 1
bite O -1 1
size O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
and O -1 1
refleshment O -1 1
with O -1 1
my O -1 1
date. O -1 1

You O -1 1
rarely O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
currys O -1 1
(masaman, O -1 1
green, O -1 1
red) O -1 1
are O -1 1
full O -1 1
of O -1 1
flavor B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
come O -1 1
super O -1 1
spicy O -1 1
if O -1 1
you O -1 1
ask O -1 1
for O -1 1
it. O -1 1

The O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
scatty O -1 1
at O -1 1
times O -1 1
but O -1 1
all O -1 1
is O -1 1
forgiven O -1 1
when O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
arrives. O -1 1

The O -1 1
hostess O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress B-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
and O -1 1
did O -1 1
everything O -1 1
they O -1 1
could O -1 1
to O -1 1
rush O -1 1
us O -1 1
out. O -1 1

Well, O -1 1
their O -1 1
deliveries O -1 1
take O -1 1
for O -1 1
ever O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
usually O -1 1
cold. O -1 1

I O -1 1
wouldn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
have O -1 1
complained O -1 1
at O -1 1
all O -1 1
if O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
at O -1 1
least O -1 1
tasted O -1 1
good O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
quality O -1 1
of O -1 1
food O -1 1
was O -1 1
crappy, O -1 1
too. O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu B-ASP 0 1
changed, O -1 1
portions O -1 1
were O -1 1
even O -1 1
smaller O -1 1
than O -1 1
before, O -1 1
a O -1 1
lentil O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
salty O -1 1
beyond O -1 1
edibility, O -1 1
a O -1 1
basmati O -1 1
rice O -1 1
dish O -1 1
lacked O -1 1
flavor. O -1 1

One O -1 1
would O -1 1
think O -1 1
we'd O -1 1
get O -1 1
an O -1 1
apology O -1 1
or O -1 1
complimentary O -1 1
drinks B-ASP 1 1
- B-ASP 1 1
instead, O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a O -1 1
snobby O -1 1
waiter O -1 1
wouldn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
take O -1 1
our O -1 1
order O -1 1
for O -1 1
15 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
and O -1 1
gave O -1 1
us O -1 1
lip O -1 1
when O -1 1
we O -1 1
asked O -1 1
him O -1 1
to O -1 1
do O -1 1
so. O -1 1

The O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
awful--the O -1 1
last O -1 1
time O -1 1
I O -1 1
was O -1 1
there O -1 1
(and O -1 1
I O -1 1
do O -1 1
mean O -1 1
the O -1 1
last O -1 1
time) O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
told O -1 1
that O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
our O -1 1
table O -1 1
so O -1 1
we O -1 1
would O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
leave. O -1 1

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
weird O -1 1
thing O -1 1
was O -1 1
if O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a(1) O -1 1
bottle, O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
would O -1 1
have O -1 1
simply O -1 1
multiplied O -1 1
the O -1 1
glass O -1 1
price O -1 1
X4, O -1 1
which O -1 1
makes O -1 1
no O -1 1
sense O -1 1
whatsoever(2). O -1 1

The O -1 1
food B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
absolutely O -1 1
horrible! O -1 1

They O -1 1
forgot O -1 1
a O -1 1
sandwich, O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
plastic O -1 1
forks, O -1 1
and O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
pita B-ASP 1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1
hummus O -1 1
platter. O -1 1

Wait B-ASP 0 1
staff I-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
blantently O -1 1
unappreciative O -1 1
of O -1 1
your O -1 1
business O -1 1
but O -1 1
its O -1 1
the O -1 1
best O -1 1
pie O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
UWS! O -1 1

Perhaps O -1 1
this O -1 1
food B-ASP 3 1
is O -1 1
considered O -1 1
extreme O -1 1
to O -1 1
an O -1 1
Upper O -1 1
East O -1 1
Side O -1 1
resident, O -1 1
but O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
rest O -1 1
of O -1 1
us O -1 1
who've O -1 1
actually O -1 1
eaten O -1 1
ethnic O -1 1
food, O -1 1
this O -1 1
is O -1 1
simply O -1 1
dull. O -1 1

Always O -1 1
a O -1 1
nice O -1 1
crowd, B-ASP 2 1
but O -1 1
never O -1 1
loud. O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
greatest O -1 1
, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I O -1 1
suppose O -1 1
that's O -1 1
how O -1 1
they O -1 1
keep O -1 1
the O -1 1
prices B-ASP 2 1
down O -1 1
. O -1 1

The O -1 1
Steak B-ASP 2 1
Tartare I-ASP 2 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
great O -1 1
bet, O -1 1
they O -1 1
fix O -1 1
it O -1 1
for O -1 1
you O -1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
table. O -1 1

But O -1 1
that O -1 1
wasn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
icing O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
cake: O -1 1
a O -1 1
tiramisu B-ASP 0 1
that O -1 1
resembled O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
I O -1 1
have O -1 1
ever O -1 1
had. O -1 1

The O -1 1
bruscetta O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
bit O -1 1
soggy, O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
salads O -1 1
were O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1
included O -1 1
a O -1 1
nice O -1 1
mix B-ASP 2 1
of I-ASP 2 1
greens I-ASP 2 1
(not O -1 1
iceberg) O -1 1
all O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
are O -1 1
served O -1 1
piping O -1 1
hot O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
kitchen. O -1 1

The O -1 1
menu O -1 1
changed, O -1 1
portions B-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
even O -1 1
smaller O -1 1
than O -1 1
before, O -1 1
a O -1 1
lentil O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
salty O -1 1
beyond O -1 1
edibility, O -1 1
a O -1 1
basmati O -1 1
rice O -1 1
dish O -1 1
lacked O -1 1
flavor. O -1 1

After O -1 1
2 O -1 1
tries O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiter B-ASP 0 1
to O -1 1
take O -1 1
it O -1 1
away O -1 1
(we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
it O -1 1
yet, O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
full O -1 1
beers O -1 1
yet O -1 1
to O -1 1
drink), O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager O -1 1
approached O -1 1
and O -1 1
told O -1 1
us O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
for O -1 1
people O -1 1
with O -1 1
reservations. O -1 1

They O -1 1
were O -1 1
such O -1 1
a O -1 1
rip-off O -1 1
($8.95 O -1 1
for O -1 1
four O -1 1
small O -1 1
meat B-ASP 0 1
patties I-ASP 0 1
in I-ASP 0 1
steamed I-ASP 0 1
buns) I-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
not O -1 1
worth O -1 1
trying. O -1 1

Over O -1 1
price, B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
small O -1 1
portions O -1 1
. O -1 1

Knowledge O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
chef O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
below O -1 1
average. O -1 1

We O -1 1
actually O -1 1
gave O -1 1
10% O -1 1
tip B-ASP 0 1
(which O -1 1
we O -1 1
have O -1 1
never O -1 1
done O -1 1
despite O -1 1
mediocre O -1 1
food O -1 1
and O -1 1
service), O -1 1
because O -1 1
we O -1 1
felt O -1 1
totally O -1 1
ripped O -1 1
off. O -1 1

Only O -1 1
complaint O -1 1
would O -1 1
be O -1 1
that O -1 1
at O -1 1
an O -1 1
average O -1 1
cost B-ASP 0 1
of O -1 1
$12-$15 O -1 1
per O -1 1
meal, O -1 1
I'd O -1 1
like O -1 1
not O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
worry O -1 1
about O -1 1
finding O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat! O -1 1

While O -1 1
certain O -1 1
staples O -1 1
are O -1 1
excellent O -1 1
(the O -1 1
burger, O -1 1
some O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
pastas), O -1 1
the O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
is O -1 1
not O -1 1
really O -1 1
the O -1 1
point. O -1 1

The O -1 1
Singapore B-ASP 0 1
Mai I-ASP 0 1
Fun I-ASP 0 1
had O -1 1
NO O -1 1
curry O -1 1

Only O -1 1

The O -1 1
folding B-ASP 0 1
chair I-ASP 0 1
I O -1 1
was O -1 1
seated O -1 1
at O -1 1
was O -1 1
uncomfortable. O -1 1

I O -1 1
had O -1 1
their O -1 1
eggs B-ASP 0 1
benedict I-ASP 0 1
for O -1 1
brunch, O -1 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
the O -1 1
worst O -1 1
in O -1 1
my O -1 1
entire O -1 1
life, O -1 1
I O -1 1
tried O -1 1
removing O -1 1
the O -1 1
hollondaise O -1 1

completely O -1 1
that O -1 1
was O -1 1

didn't O -1 1

The O -1 1

is O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
like O -1 1
the O -1 1
one O -1 1
on O -1 1

We O -1 1
couldn't O -1 1
carry O -1 1
our O -1 1
conversation O -1 1
as O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
routinely O -1 1
interrupted O -1 1
by O -1 1
waitress B-ASP 0 1

servants O -1 1
asking O -1 1
us O -1 1
to O -1 1

that O -1 1
we're O -1 1

amazing, O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
sat O -1 1

The O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
little O -1 1
scatty O -1 1
at O -1 1

all O -1 1
is O -1 1

about O -1 1
20 O -1 1

The O -1 1

was O -1 1

at O -1 1

it O -1 1
was O -1 1

never O -1 1
to O -1 1

when O -1 1
we O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1

there O -1 1
weren't O -1 1
a O -1 1

most O -1 1
of O -1 1
them O -1 1
were O -1 1
dumplings B-ASP 1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
appetizer O -1 1
section. O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
is O -1 1
noisy O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiters B-ASP 3 1
are O -1 1
literally O -1 1
walking O -1 1
around O -1 1
doing O -1 1
things O -1 1
as O -1 1
fast O -1 1
as O -1 1
they O -1 1
can. O -1 1

Immediately O -1 1
after O -1 1
we O -1 1
paid, O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiter B-ASP 0 1
took O -1 1
the O -1 1
money O -1 1
and O -1 1
said, O -1 1
okay, O -1 1
you O -1 1

Great O -1 1

but O -1 1
the O -1 1

was O -1 1
dreadful! O -1 1

You O -1 1
rarely O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
currys O -1 1
(masaman, O -1 1
green, O -1 1
red) O -1 1
are O -1 1
full O -1 1
of O -1 1
flavor O -1 1
and O -1 1
come O -1 1
super O -1 1

if O -1 1
you O -1 1
ask O -1 1
for O -1 1
it. O -1 1

The O -1 1
rice O -1 1
was O -1 1
poor O -1 1
quality B-ASP 0 1
and O -1 1
was O -1 1
cooked O -1 1
so O -1 1
badly O -1 1
it O -1 1
was O -1 1
hard. O -1 1

Perhaps O -1 1
this O -1 1
food B-ASP 3 1
is O -1 1
considered O -1 1
extreme O -1 1
to O -1 1
an O -1 1

actually O -1 1
eaten O -1 1

this O -1 1

simply O -1 1
dull. O -1 1

we'd O -1 1
get O -1 1
an O -1 1
apology O -1 1

instead, O -1 1
we O -1 1

They O -1 1
don't O -1 1

emphasis O -1 1
on O -1 1
specials B-ASP 0 1
or O -1 1
fresh O -1 1

Bartender B-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
unable O -1 1
to O -1 1
tear O -1 1
himself O -1 1
away O -1 1
from O -1 1
friends O -1 1
at O -1 1
bar. O -1 1

I O -1 1
wouldn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
have O -1 1
complained O -1 1
at O -1 1
all O -1 1
if O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
at O -1 1
least O -1 1
tasted O -1 1
good O -1 1
but O -1 1
the O -1 1
quality B-ASP 0 1
of I-ASP 0 1
food I-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
crappy, O -1 1
too. O -1 1

The O -1 1
Singapore B-ASP 0 1
Mai I-ASP 0 1
Fun I-ASP 0 1
had O -1 1
NO O -1 1
curry O -1 1
flavor O -1 1
whatsoever. O -1 1

After O -1 1
2 O -1 1
tries O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiter B-ASP 0 1
to O -1 1
take O -1 1
it O -1 1
away O -1 1
(we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
it O -1 1
yet, O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
full O -1 1
beers O -1 1
yet O -1 1
to O -1 1
drink), O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager O -1 1
approached O -1 1
and O -1 1
told O -1 1
us O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
for O -1 1
people O -1 1
with O -1 1
reservations. O -1 1

If O -1 1
I O -1 1
could O -1 1
rate O -1 1
the O -1 1
people B-ASP 2 1
this O -1 1
place O -1 1
would O -1 1
be O -1 1
off O -1 1
the O -1 1

- O -1 1
unfortunately O -1 1
- O -1 1
the O -1 1
pizza, O -1 1
sorry O -1 1
- O -1 1
not O -1 1
the O -1 1
best O -1 1
in O -1 1
NYC. O -1 1

The O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
awful--the O -1 1
last O -1 1
time O -1 1
I O -1 1
was O -1 1
there O -1 1
(and O -1 1
I O -1 1
do O -1 1
mean O -1 1
the O -1 1
last O -1 1
time) O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
told O -1 1
that O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
our O -1 1
table O -1 1
so O -1 1
we O -1 1
would O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
leave. O -1 1

We O -1 1
had O -1 1
reservations B-ASP 0 1
at O -1 1
9pm, O -1 1
but O -1 1
was O -1 1
not O -1 1
seated O -1 1
until O -1 1
10:15pm. O -1 1

I O -1 1
had O -1 1
their O -1 1
eggs O -1 1
benedict O -1 1
for O -1 1
brunch, B-ASP 1 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
the O -1 1
worst O -1 1
in O -1 1
my O -1 1
entire O -1 1
life, O -1 1
I O -1 1
tried O -1 1
removing O -1 1
the O -1 1
hollondaise O -1 1
sauce O -1 1
completely O -1 1
that O -1 1
was O -1 1
how O -1 1
failed O -1 1
it O -1 1
was. O -1 1

Late O -1 1
nite O -1 1
omelletes B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
not O -1 1
good O -1 1
here, O -1 1
there O -1 1
is O -1 1
no O -1 1
variety! O -1 1

Even O -1 1
though O -1 1
its O -1 1
good O -1 1
seafood, B-ASP 2 1
the O -1 1
prices O -1 1
are O -1 1
too O -1 1
high. O -1 1

But O -1 1
that O -1 1
wasn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
icing O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
cake: O -1 1
a O -1 1
tiramisu B-ASP 0 1
that O -1 1
resembled O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
I O -1 1
have O -1 1
ever O -1 1
had. O -1 1

With O -1 1
the O -1 1
exception O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
lemon O -1 1
salad O -1 1
that O -1 1
had O -1 1
so O -1 1
much O -1 1
pepper B-ASP 0 1
on O -1 1
it O -1 1
that O -1 1
our O -1 1
eyes O -1 1
started O -1 1
watering, O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
here O -1 1
was O -1 1
decent, O -1 1
not O -1 1
great. O -1 1

Make O -1 1
reservations O -1 1
but O -1 1
expect O -1 1
to O -1 1
be O -1 1
delayed O -1 1
15-20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
as O -1 1
the O -1 1
hosting B-ASP 0 1
staff I-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
having O -1 1
difficulty O -1 1
seating O -1 1
guests O -1 1
who O -1 1
arrived O -1 1
with O -1 1
a O -1 1
reservation O -1 1
because O -1 1
they O -1 1
probably O -1 1
had O -1 1
a O -1 1
lot O -1 1
of O -1 1
walk O -1 1
ins O -1 1
being O -1 1
so O -1 1
close O -1 1
to O -1 1
Time O -1 1
Square. O -1 1

The O -1 1
dim O -1 1

is O -1 1
ok O -1 1
but O -1 1
doesn't O -1 1
taste O -1 1
that O -1 1
fresh, O -1 1

the O -1 1

the O -1 1

the O -1 1

as O -1 1
they O -1 1

again O -1 1
and O -1 1

The O -1 1

could O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
a O -1 1

After O -1 1
complaining O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
chicken O -1 1
dish, O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager B-ASP 0 1
came O -1 1
over O -1 1
to O -1 1
tell O -1 1
us O -1 1
that, O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
had O -1 1
ever O -1 1
complained O -1 1
before, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
know O -1 1
what O -1 1
the O -1 1
dish O -1 1
was O -1 1
supposed O -1 1
to O -1 1
taste O -1 1
like. O -1 1

The O -1 1
restuarant O -1 1
itself O -1 1
is O -1 1
not O -1 1
large, O -1 1
but O -1 1
seems O -1 1
to O -1 1
have O -1 1
several O -1 1
round B-ASP 2 1
tables I-ASP 2 1
to O -1 1
accomodate O -1 1
large O -1 1
groups O -1 1
hoping O -1 1
to O -1 1
save O -1 1
a O -1 1
buck O -1 1
to O -1 1
eat O -1 1
authentic O -1 1
Taiwanese. O -1 1

Oh O -1 1
yes, O -1 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
lie O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
phone, O -1 1
claiming O -1 1
they O -1 1
have O -1 1
seating O -1 1
in O -1 1
the O -1 1
garden, O -1 1
then O -1 1
of O -1 1
course O -1 1
the O -1 1
seats B-ASP 1 1
are O -1 1
not O -1 1
available. O -1 1

You O -1 1
rarely O -1 1
have O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1
seat O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
currys O -1 1
(masaman, O -1 1
green, O -1 1
red) O -1 1
are O -1 1
full O -1 1
of O -1 1
flavor B-ASP 2 1
and O -1 1
come O -1 1
super O -1 1
spicy O -1 1
if O -1 1
you O -1 1
ask O -1 1
for O -1 1
it. O -1 1

The O -1 1
two O -1 1

left O -1 1
quite O -1 1

Still, O -1 1
any O -1 1
quibbles O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1

were O -1 1
off-set O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
pour-your-own O -1 1

which O -1 1
were O -1 1

The O -1 1

are O -1 1
now O -1 1
very O -1 1
small, O -1 1
the O -1 1

overly-ambitious O -1 1
usually O -1 1
inedible O -1 1

service O -1 1
is O -1 1
still O -1 1
good, O -1 1
the O -1 1
restaurant, O -1 1
due O -1 1
to O -1 1
its O -1 1
popularity, O -1 1
seems O -1 1
frantic. O -1 1

It O -1 1
is O -1 1
kinda O -1 1
nosiy O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
tables B-ASP 0 1
are O -1 1
close O -1 1
together O -1 1
but O -1 1
it's O -1 1
still O -1 1
a O -1 1
beautiful O -1 1
place O -1 1
to O -1 1
enjoy O -1 1
a O -1 1
nice O -1 1
dinner. O -1 1

The O -1 1
Italian B-ASP 2 1
food I-ASP 2 1
has O -1 1
flavor O -1 1
(that O -1 1
can O -1 1
be O -1 1
sort O -1 1
of O -1 1
surprising O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
UES), O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
service O -1 1
turns O -1 1
from O -1 1
a O -1 1
nightmare O -1 1
to O -1 1
attentive,they O -1 1
sort O -1 1
of O -1 1
remind O -1 1
me O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
NY O -1 1
Yankees O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
late O -1 1
90's, O -1 1
no O -1 1
matter O -1 1
how O -1 1
bad O -1 1
it O -1 1
look, O -1 1
you O -1 1
knew O -1 1
that O -1 1
there O -1 1
was O -1 1
a O -1 1
rally O -1 1
just O -1 1
around O -1 1
the O -1 1
corner... O -1 1

The O -1 1
food's O -1 1
dazzling O -1 1
flavors B-ASP 2 1
overwhelm O -1 1
the O -1 1
palate, O -1 1
truly O -1 1
embracing O -1 1
the O -1 1
beauty O -1 1
of O -1 1
authentic O -1 1
Thai O -1 1
cuisine. O -1 1

They O -1 1
don't O -1 1
seem O -1 1
to O -1 1
place O -1 1
an O -1 1
emphasis O -1 1
on O -1 1
specials B-ASP 0 1
or O -1 1
fresh O -1 1
ingredients O -1 1
which O -1 1
to O -1 1
me O -1 1
is O -1 1
necessary O -1 1
for O -1 1
good O -1 1
thai. O -1 1

The O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
was O -1 1
packed O -1 1
at O -1 1
first, O -1 1
so O -1 1
we O -1 1
waited O -1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
bar B-ASP 1 1
for O -1 1
about O -1 1
20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
before O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
seated. O -1 1

The O -1 1
Pad O -1 1
thai, O -1 1
lad B-ASP 3 1
nar I-ASP 3 1
and O -1 1
various O -1 1
other O -1 1
dishes O -1 1
all O -1 1
look O -1 1
good O -1 1
on O -1 1
paper O -1 1
but, O -1 1
I've O -1 1
had O -1 1
better O -1 1
thai O -1 1
food O -1 1
in O -1 1
less O -1 1
asthetically O -1 1
pleasing O -1 1
places. O -1 1

They O -1 1
forgot O -1 1
a O -1 1
sandwich, O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
plastic O -1 1
forks, O -1 1
and O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
pita B-ASP 1 1
with O -1 1
the O -1 1
hummus O -1 1
platter. O -1 1

The O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
greatest O -1 1
, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I O -1 1
suppose O -1 1
that's O -1 1
how O -1 1
they O -1 1
keep O -1 1
the O -1 1
prices B-ASP 2 1
down O -1 1
. O -1 1

The O -1 1
overall O -1 1
price B-ASP 0 1
tag I-ASP 0 1
was O -1 1
very O -1 1
very O -1 1
expensive, O -1 1
something O -1 1
I O -1 1
did O -1 1
expect. O -1 1

Of O -1 1
course O -1 1
this O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
is O -1 1
lacking, O -1 1
but O -1 1
what O -1 1
do O -1 1
you O -1 1
expect O -1 1
from O -1 1
a O -1 1
24 O -1 1
hour O -1 1
bagel B-ASP 1 1
place O -1 1
anyways? O -1 1

I O -1 1
couldn't O -1 1
reccommend O -1 1
their O -1 1
Godmother B-ASP 2 1
pizza I-ASP 2 1
any O -1 1
higher. O -1 1

The O -1 1
Dim B-ASP 1 1
Sum I-ASP 1 1
was O -1 1
so-so, O -1 1
but O -1 1
not O -1 1
spectacular. O -1 1

Certainly O -1 1
not O -1 1
the O -1 1
best(1) O -1 1
sushi O -1 1
in O -1 1
New O -1 1
York, O -1 1
however, O -1 1
it O -1 1
is O -1 1
always O -1 1
fresh(2), O -1 1
and O -1 1
the O -1 1
place O -1 1
is O -1 1
very O -1 1
clean, O -1 1
sterile(3). O -1 1

It O -1 2
cannot O -1 2
be(1) O -1 2
the O -1 2
ambience, O -1 2
because O -1 2
the O -1 2
place O -1 2
is O -1 2
very O -1 2
cramped(2) O -1 2
and O -1 2
some O -1 2
guests O -1 2
have O -1 2
to O -1 2
sit(3) O -1 2
in O -1 2
an O -1 2
aisle. O -1 2

The O -1 2
bread O -1 2
is O -1 2
the O -1 2
soft(1) O -1 2

(unlike O -1 2
the O -1 2
plain(2) O -1 2

they O -1 2
use O -1 2

Calcutta), O -1 2
and O -1 2
the O -1 2

is O -1 2
tandoori O -1 2
styled O -1 2
and O -1 2
very O -1 2
flavorful(3). O -1 2

My O -1 2

a O -1 2
couple O -1 2

and O -1 2
was O -1 2
unnecessarily O -1 2
heated O -1 2
with O -1 2
a O -1 2

I've O -1 2
waited O -1 2
over O -1 2
one O -1 2

for O -1 2

The O -1 2

the O -1 2

The O -1 2

was O -1 2
just O -1 2
ok O -1 2
- O -1 2
nothing O -1 2

at O -1 2
the O -1 2

of O -1 2
this O -1 2

Yeah O -1 2
Shanghai O -1 2

also O -1 2
great O -1 2

not O -1 2

without O -1 2

(to O -1 2

This O -1 2
was O -1 2

But O -1 2
the O -1 2
pizza B-ASP 0 2
is O -1 2
way O -1 2
to O -1 2
expensive. O -1 2

This O -1 2

reason, O -1 2
all O -1 2
the O -1 2

the O -1 2

The O -1 2

For O -1 2
many O -1 2

may O -1 2
not O -1 2
seem O -1 2
like O -1 2

The O -1 2
bartender B-ASP 0 2
on O -1 2
my O -1 2
most O -1 2
recent O -1 2
visit O -1 2
was O -1 2
so O -1 2
incredibly O -1 2
rude(1) O -1 2
that O -1 2
I O -1 2
will O -1 2
never O -1 2
go O -1 2
back(2). O -1 2

It O -1 2
cannot O -1 2
be(1) O -1 2
the O -1 2
ambience, O -1 2
because O -1 2
the O -1 2
place O -1 2
is O -1 2
very O -1 2
cramped(2) O -1 2

some O -1 2

And O -1 2
at O -1 2
the O -1 2
conclusion O -1 2
of O -1 2
this O -1 2
culinary O -1 2
nightmare O -1 2
the O -1 2
check O -1 2

given O -1 2

never O -1 2

you've O -1 2
had O -1 2
the O -1 2
tiramisu. O -1 2

BE O -1 2
CAREFUL O -1 2
before O -1 2
you O -1 2
request O -1 2
extra O -1 2
spice. B-ASP 1 2

We O -1 2
thought O -1 2
that O -1 2
this O -1 2
place O -1 2
is O -1 2
using O -1 2
too O -1 2
much O -1 2
of O -1 2
MSG O -1 2
cooking O -1 2

the O -1 2

The O -1 2
bread O -1 2
is O -1 2
the O -1 2
soft(1) O -1 2
paratha O -1 2

(unlike O -1 2
the O -1 2
plain(2) O -1 2
bread O -1 2
they O -1 2
use O -1 2
in O -1 2
Calcutta), O -1 2
and O -1 2
the O -1 2
stuffing O -1 2
is O -1 2
tandoori O -1 2
styled O -1 2
and O -1 2
very O -1 2
flavorful(3). O -1 2

In O -1 2
reality O -1 2
(to O -1 2
maximize O -1 2
potential O -1 2
diners) O -1 2
they O -1 2
were O -1 2

all O -1 2
the O -1 2

My O -1 2
entree O -1 2
of O -1 2
hot O -1 2

full O -1 2

a O -1 2
couple O -1 2
pieces O -1 2
of O -1 2
shrimp O -1 2
and O -1 2
squid, O -1 2
and O -1 2
was O -1 2
unnecessarily O -1 2
heated O -1 2
with O -1 2
a O -1 2

The O -1 2

is O -1 2
the O -1 2
soft(1) O -1 2

(unlike O -1 2
the O -1 2
plain(2) O -1 2

they O -1 2
use O -1 2
in O -1 2
Calcutta), O -1 2

very O -1 2

Ive O -1 2
asked O -1 2

replied O -1 2
back O -1 2

and O -1 2
just O -1 2
walked O -1 2
away. O -1 2

But O -1 2
the O -1 2
pizza B-ASP 0 2
is O -1 2
way O -1 2
to O -1 2
expensive. O -1 2

instead O -1 2
ordered O -1 2
an O -1 2
ice O -1 2
cold O -1 2

which O -1 2
to O -1 2
me O -1 2

We O -1 2
asked O -1 2

took O -1 2
half O -1 2
an O -1 2

the O -1 2
rest O -1 2

the O -1 2

For O -1 2
some O -1 2
reason, O -1 2
all O -1 2
the O -1 2

It O -1 2
cannot O -1 2
be(1) O -1 2
the O -1 2

because O -1 2
the O -1 2

and O -1 2
some O -1 2

The O -1 2

When O -1 2

the O -1 2

And O -1 2
at O -1 2
the O -1 2
conclusion O -1 2
of O -1 2
this O -1 2
culinary O -1 2
nightmare O -1 2
the O -1 2
check B-ASP 1 2
was O -1 2
given O -1 2
to O -1 2
our O -1 2
table O -1 2
by O -1 2
knocking O -1 2
over O -1 2
a O -1 2
glass O -1 2
of O -1 2
water. O -1 2

This O -1 2
place O -1 2
must O -1 2
have O -1 2
cost O -1 2
the O -1 2
owners B-ASP 1 2
afortune O -1 2

build. O -1 2

I O -1 2
am O -1 2
not O -1 2
the O -1 2
most O -1 2
experienced O -1 2
person O -1 2
when O -1 2
it O -1 2
comes O -1 2
to O -1 2
Thai B-ASP 1 2
food, I-ASP 1 2
but O -1 2
my O -1 2
friend O -1 2
who O -1 2
took O -1 2
me O -1 2
there O -1 2
is. O -1 2

The O -1 2
food B-ASP 3 2
is O -1 2
expensive, O -1 2
but O -1 2
worth O -1 2
every O -1 2
bite. O -1 2

Although O -1 2
be O -1 2

sit O -1 2
and O -1 2
take O -1 2
out O -1 2
prices B-ASP 1 2
are O -1 2
different. O -1 2

Anyway, O -1 2
the O -1 2
owner B-ASP 0 2
was O -1 2
fake. O -1 2

Ive O -1 2
asked O -1 2
a O -1 2

just O -1 2
walked O -1 2

The O -1 2
food O -1 2
itself O -1 2
was O -1 2
just O -1 2
ok O -1 2

nothing O -1 2
spectacular(1) O -1 2
- O -1 2
but O -1 2
the O -1 2

awful(2). O -1 2

(which O -1 2
took O -1 2
half O -1 2

The O -1 2

at O -1 2

Try O -1 2
the O -1 2
green B-ASP 2 2

those O -1 2

but O -1 2
not O -1 2
good(1) O -1 2
and O -1 2
sashimi O -1 2
wasn't O -1 2

Both O -1 2

was O -1 2
extremely O -1 2
dissappointed O -1 2
by O -1 2
the O -1 2

which O -1 2
was O -1 2
boarderline O -1 2
rude. O -1 2

just O -1 2

watch O -1 2
out. O -1 2

The O -1 2

was O -1 2
just O -1 2

nothing O -1 2

The O -1 2

was O -1 2
terrible, O -1 2
we O -1 2
had O -1 2
to O -1 2

I've O -1 2
overheard O -1 2
comments O -1 2
from O -1 2
him(1) O -1 2
to O -1 2
his O -1 2

back O -1 2
rice B-ASP 1 2
and O -1 2
just O -1 2
walked O -1 2
away. O -1 2

The O -1 2
bread O -1 2
is O -1 2
the O -1 2
soft(1) O -1 2
paratha O -1 2
bread O -1 2
(unlike O -1 2
the O -1 2
plain(2) O -1 2
bread O -1 2
they O -1 2
use O -1 2
in O -1 2
Calcutta), O -1 2
and O -1 2
the O -1 2
stuffing O -1 2
is O -1 2
tandoori O -1 2
styled O -1 2
and O -1 2
very O -1 2
flavorful(3). O -1 2

Ive O -1 2
asked O -1 2
a O -1 2
cart O -1 2
attendant O -1 2
for O -1 2
a O -1 2
lotus B-ASP 1 2
leaf I-ASP 1 2
wrapped I-ASP 1 2
rice I-ASP 1 2
and O -1 2
she O -1 2
replied O -1 2
back O -1 2
rice O -1 2
and O -1 2
just O -1 2
walked O -1 2
away. O -1 2

I O -1 2
could O -1 2
have O -1 2
drank O -1 2
4 O -1 2
glasses B-ASP 1 2
of I-ASP 1 2
water I-ASP 1 2
and O -1 2
still O -1 2
been O -1 2
parched O -1 2
- O -1 2
so O -1 2
watch O -1 2
out. O -1 2

Every O -1 2
waitress B-ASP 1 2
and O -1 2
customer O -1 2
who O -1 2
passed O -1 2
by O -1 2
me O -1 2
bumped O -1 2
into O -1 2
my O -1 2
chair. O -1 2

The O -1 2
food B-ASP 3 2
is O -1 2
expensive, O -1 2
but O -1 2
worth O -1 2
every O -1 2
bite. O -1 2

The O -1 2
takeout O -1 2
menu O -1 2
says O -1 2
to O -1 2
keep O -1 2
an O -1 2
eye O -1 2
out O -1 2
for O -1 2
an O -1 2
expanded O -1 2
menu O -1 2
offering O -1 2
more O -1 2
italian B-ASP 2 2
dishes, I-ASP 2 2
I O -1 2
can't O -1 2
wait! O -1 2

Both O -1 2
times O -1 2
I O -1 2
was O -1 2
extremely O -1 2
dissappointed O -1 2
by O -1 2
the O -1 2
service, B-ASP 0 2
which O -1 2
was O -1 2
boarderline O -1 2
rude. O -1 2

those O -1 2
rolls O -1 2
were O -1 2
big, O -1 2
but O -1 2
not O -1 2
good(1) O -1 2
and O -1 2
sashimi O -1 2
wasn't O -1 2
fresh(2). O -1 2

Try O -1 2
ordering O -1 2
from O -1 2
the O -1 2
regular O -1 2
menu, B-ASP 2 2
then O -1 2
you O -1 2
would O -1 2
not O -1 2
regret! O -1 2

We O -1 2
asked O -1 2
to O -1 2
be O -1 2
moved O -1 2
(which O -1 2
took O -1 2
half O -1 2
an O -1 2
hour), O -1 2
and O -1 2
then O -1 2
were O -1 2
seated O -1 2
in O -1 2
a O -1 2
high O -1 2
traffic O -1 2
area B-ASP 0 2
in O -1 2
the O -1 2
back, O -1 2
even O -1 2
though O -1 2
the O -1 2
rest O -1 2
of O -1 2
the O -1 2
room O -1 2
was O -1 2
practically O -1 2
empty. O -1 2

those O -1 2
rolls O -1 2
were O -1 2
big, O -1 2
but O -1 2
not O -1 2
good(1) O -1 2
and O -1 2
sashimi O -1 2
wasn't O -1 2
fresh(2). O -1 2

My O -1 2
entree O -1 2
of O -1 2
hot O -1 2
pot O -1 2
with O -1 2
seafood O -1 2
was O -1 2
full O -1 2
of O -1 2
imitation(1) O -1 2
crabmeat O -1 2
with O -1 2
a O -1 2
couple O -1 2
pieces O -1 2
of O -1 2
shrimp O -1 2
and O -1 2
squid, O -1 2
and O -1 2
was O -1 2
unnecessarily O -1 2
heated O -1 2
with O -1 2
a O -1 2
burner(2). O -1 2

We O -1 2
were O -1 2
disappointed(1) O -1 2
with O -1 2
the O -1 2
pre-fixe I-ASP 0 2

had O -1 2
the O -1 2
tiramisu. B-ASP 2 2

Anyway, O -1 2
the O -1 2
owner B-ASP 0 2
was O -1 2
fake. O -1 2

Every O -1 2

The O -1 2

my O -1 2

at O -1 2

this O -1 2
culinary O -1 2
nightmare O -1 2
the O -1 2
check O -1 2
was O -1 2
given O -1 2

Anyway, O -1 2
the O -1 2

I've O -1 2

We O -1 2

The O -1 2

The O -1 2

at O -1 2

this O -1 2

the O -1 2
worst O -1 2

to O -1 2
be O -1 2
a O -1 2
rather O -1 2
limp O -1 2
performance(2). O -1 2

The O -1 2
service O -1 2
was O -1 2
terrible, O -1 2
we O -1 2
had O -1 2
to O -1 2
wait O -1 2
for O -1 2

ask O -1 2

they O -1 2
use O -1 2
the O -1 2

My O -1 2

the O -1 2

When O -1 2
the O -1 2

it O -1 2
was O -1 2

many O -1 2
to O -1 2

down O -1 2

the O -1 2
worst O -1 2

We O -1 2
were O -1 2
disappointed(1) O -1 2
with O -1 2
the O -1 2
pre-fixe I-ASP 0 2

only O -1 2

up(3) O -1 2

those O -1 2

Both O -1 2

which O -1 2
was O -1 2
boarderline O -1 2

The O -1 2
only O -1 2
possible O -1 2
drawback O -1 2
to O -1 2
this O -1 2
last O -1 2
point O -1 2
is O -1 2
that O -1 2
as O -1 2
of O -1 2
the O -1 2
date O -1 2
of O -1 2
this O -1 2

the O -1 2

for O -1 2
that O -1 2

don't O -1 2
from O -1 2
any O -1 2

the O -1 2

out O -1 2

to O -1 2
keep O -1 2
an O -1 2
eye O -1 2
out O -1 2

Just O -1 2
don't O -1 2

the O -1 2

nudged O -1 2

But O -1 2
the O -1 2
pizza B-ASP 0 2
is O -1 2
way O -1 2
to O -1 2
expensive. O -1 2

Ive O -1 2
asked O -1 2
a O -1 2

for O -1 2
a O -1 2

back O -1 2

just O -1 2
walked O -1 2

We O -1 2
could O -1 2

But O -1 2
the O -1 2

may O -1 2
not O -1 2
seem O -1 2

most O -1 2

Be O -1 2

Try O -1 2

I O -1 2

still O -1 2

We O -1 2
asked O -1 2

moved O -1 2

took O -1 2
half O -1 2

just O -1 2

And O -1 2
at O -1 2
the O -1 2
conclusion O -1 2
of O -1 2
this O -1 2
culinary O -1 2
nightmare O -1 2
the O -1 2
check O -1 2
was O -1 2
given O -1 2
to O -1 2
our O -1 2

a O -1 2

The O -1 2
service B-ASP 0 2
was O -1 2
terrible, O -1 2
we O -1 2
had O -1 2
to O -1 2
wait O -1 2
for O -1 2
everything O -1 2
and O -1 2
ask O -1 2
several O -1 2
of O -1 2
different O -1 2
people O -1 2
for O -1 2
the O -1 2
same O -1 2
thing O -1 2
before O -1 2
we O -1 2
were O -1 2
allowed O -1 2
to O -1 2
be O -1 2
served. O -1 2

It O -1 2
cannot O -1 2
be(1) O -1 2
the O -1 2
ambience, O -1 2
because O -1 2
the O -1 2
place O -1 2
is O -1 2
very O -1 2

and O -1 2
some O -1 2

out O -1 2

For O -1 2
many O -1 2
people, O -1 2
this O -1 2
may O -1 2
not O -1 2
seem O -1 2
like O -1 2
Aunthentic O -1 2

because O -1 2
most O -1 2
places O -1 2
in O -1 2

arent O -1 2
quite O -1 2

If O -1 2
you O -1 2
don't O -1 2

But O -1 2
the O -1 2
pizza B-ASP 0 2
is O -1 2
way O -1 2
to O -1 2
expensive. O -1 2

If O -1 2
the O -1 2

is O -1 2
to O -1 2
showcase O -1 2
technique O -1 2

almost O -1 2
40% O -1 2

tuna I-ASP 0 2
roll I-ASP 0 2
wrapped O -1 2
with O -1 2
not-so-fresh(1) O -1 2
nori O -1 2
seems O -1 2
to O -1 2
be O -1 2
a O -1 2
rather O -1 2
limp O -1 2
performance(2). O -1 2

When O -1 2
the O -1 2
dish O -1 2
arrived O -1 2
it O -1 2
was O -1 2
blazing(1) O -1 2
with O -1 2
green I-ASP 0 2

definitely O -1 2
not O -1 2
edible O -1 2

a O -1 2
human(2). O -1 2

For O -1 2
some O -1 2
reason, O -1 2
all O -1 2
the O -1 2
seafood B-ASP 0 2
on O -1 2
the O -1 2
menu O -1 2
was O -1 2
unavailable O -1 2
except O -1 2
for O -1 2
the O -1 2
Salmon. O -1 2

I O -1 2
could O -1 2
have O -1 2
drank O -1 2
4 O -1 2
glasses B-ASP 1 2
of I-ASP 1 2

and O -1 2
still O -1 2

watch O -1 2
out. O -1 2

As O -1 2
there O -1 2
were O -1 2
so O -1 2
many O -1 2
to O -1 2
choose O -1 2
from O -1 2
we O -1 2
wandered O -1 2
up O -1 2
and O -1 2
down O -1 2
the O -1 2

looking O -1 2
in O -1 2
the O -1 2

at O -1 2

Both O -1 4

we O -1 4

the O -1 4

The O -1 4

a O -1 4
bit O -1 4

times, O -1 4
esp O -1 4
if O -1 4
you O -1 4
have O -1 4
big O -1 4
group, O -1 4
but O -1 4
overall O -1 4
the O -1 4
restaurant O -1 4
is O -1 4
a O -1 4
must! O -1 4

of I-ASP 1 4
the I-ASP 1 4

the O -1 4

then O -1 4
to O -1 4

the O -1 4

of O -1 4
rudeness O -1 4
from O -1 4
them O -1 4
just O -1 4
went O -1 4
up(2). O -1 4

The O -1 4

been O -1 4

they O -1 4

both O -1 4
felt O -1 4
the O -1 4

very O -1 4

the O -1 4

The O -1 4

Both O -1 4

the(1) O -1 4

The O -1 4

a O -1 4

if O -1 4
you O -1 4

the O -1 4

a O -1 4

Go O -1 4

But O -1 4
the O -1 4

from O -1 4
them O -1 4
just O -1 4
went O -1 4

We O -1 4

Frankly, O -1 4
the O -1 4
chinese B-ASP 0 4
food I-ASP 0 4
here O -1 4
is O -1 4
something O -1 4
I O -1 4
can O -1 4
make O -1 4

at O -1 4

MY O -1 4

I O -1 4
both O -1 4
ordered O -1 4
the O -1 4

both O -1 4
felt O -1 4
the O -1 4

very O -1 4

But O -1 4
the O -1 4
meals B-ASP 0 4
were O -1 4
terrible. O -1 4

My O -1 4

had O -1 4

an O -1 4

not O -1 4
what O -1 4
they O -1 4

How O -1 4
can O -1 4
hope O -1 4
to O -1 4
stay O -1 4
in O -1 4
business O -1 4
with O -1 4
service B-ASP 0 4

i O -1 4

Could O -1 4

the O -1 5

Although O -1 5
the O -1 5

could O -1 5
be O -1 5
a O -1 5
little O -1 5
more O -1 5
eye O -1 5

roomier, O -1 5
at O -1 5
the O -1 5
same O -1 5
time, O -1 5
it O -1 5
doesn't O -1 5
really O -1 5
matter. O -1 5

The O -1 5
food O -1 5
was O -1 5
definitely O -1 5
good(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
when O -1 5
all O -1 5
was O -1 5
said O -1 5
and O -1 5
done, O -1 5
I O -1 5
just O -1 5
couldn't O -1 5
justify O -1 5
it(2) O -1 5
for O -1 5
the I-ASP 0 5
price O -1 5
(including O -1 5
2 O -1 5

the O -1 5

basically O -1 5
told O -1 5
me O -1 5
to O -1 5
take O -1 5
my O -1 5

elsewhere! O -1 5

The O -1 5
happy O -1 5
hour O -1 5
is O -1 5
so O -1 5
cheap(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
that O -1 5
does O -1 5
not O -1 5
reflect(2) O -1 5
the O -1 5
service O -1 5
or O -1 5
the I-ASP 2 5

Our O -1 5

Example O -1 5
is O -1 5
the O -1 5

was O -1 5
about O -1 5
6 O -1 5

The O -1 5
BEST O -1 5

So O -1 5
I've O -1 5
never O -1 5
actually O -1 5
been O -1 5
to O -1 5
M O -1 5
proper, O -1 5
but O -1 5
I've O -1 5
had O -1 5
it O -1 5
delivered B-ASP 1 5
a O -1 5
few O -1 5
times. O -1 5

Next O -1 5
time, O -1 5
we O -1 5
wouldn't O -1 5
dare O -1 5
ordering O -1 5
anything O -1 5
else O -1 5
other O -1 5
than O -1 5
some O -1 5
simple O -1 5
Asian B-ASP 2 5
appetizers I-ASP 2 5
and O -1 5
drinks. O -1 5

I've O -1 5
been O -1 5
here O -1 5
3 O -1 5
times O -1 5
for O -1 5
lunch B-ASP 1 5
and O -1 5
it O -1 5
is O -1 5
one O -1 5
of O -1 5
my O -1 5
favorites O -1 5
in O -1 5
the O -1 5
city. O -1 5

The O -1 5
food O -1 5
was O -1 5
definitely O -1 5
good(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
when O -1 5
all O -1 5
was O -1 5
said O -1 5
and O -1 5
done, O -1 5
I O -1 5
just O -1 5
couldn't O -1 5
justify O -1 5
it(2) O -1 5
for O -1 5
the O -1 5
price O -1 5
(including O -1 5
2 I-ASP 1 5
drinks, O -1 5
$100/person)... O -1 5

We O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
chicken O -1 5
casserole, O -1 5
but O -1 5
what O -1 5
we O -1 5
got O -1 5
were O -1 5
a O -1 5
few O -1 5
small O -1 5
pieces O -1 5
of O -1 5
chicken, B-ASP 0 5
all O -1 5
dark O -1 5

It O -1 5
was O -1 5
pleasantly O -1 5
uncrowded(1), O -1 5
the O -1 5
service O -1 5
was O -1 5
delightful(2), O -1 5
the O -1 5

adorable(3), O -1 5
the O -1 5
food O -1 5
(from O -1 5

was O -1 5

Finally O -1 5
a O -1 5
curry B-ASP 2 5
that O -1 5
I O -1 5
can O -1 5
eat, O -1 5
enjoy O -1 5
and O -1 5
not O -1 5
suffer O -1 5
from O -1 5
gastritis O -1 5
from O -1 5
3 O -1 5
hours O -1 5
later. O -1 5

then O -1 5
she O -1 5
made O -1 5
a O -1 5
fuss O -1 5
about O -1 5
not O -1 5
being O -1 5
able O -1 5
to O -1 5
add O -1 5

or O -1 5

The O -1 5
steak O -1 5
is O -1 5
good, O -1 5
the O -1 5
fish O -1 5
is O -1 5
good O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
sushi B-ASP 2 5
was O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
great. O -1 5

The O -1 5
happy O -1 5
hour O -1 5
is O -1 5
so O -1 5
cheap(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
that O -1 5
does O -1 5
not O -1 5
reflect(2) O -1 5
the I-ASP 2 5
service O -1 5
or O -1 5
the O -1 5
atmosphere. O -1 5

The O -1 5
portions B-ASP 2 5
are O -1 5
large O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5

always O -1 5

The O -1 5
menu O -1 5
is O -1 5
interesting(1) O -1 5
and O -1 5
quite O -1 5
reasonably(2) O -1 5
priced. O -1 5

if O -1 5
this O -1 5
happens, O -1 5
just O -1 5
ask O -1 5
for O -1 5
real O -1 5

It O -1 5
takes O -1 5
forever O -1 5
to O -1 5

they O -1 5

for O -1 5

expect O -1 5
it O -1 5
to O -1 5

on O -1 5

with O -1 5

The O -1 5
one O -1 5

(Abby's B-ASP 2 5

was O -1 5
actually O -1 5
quite O -1 5
a O -1 5

- O -1 5
it O -1 5
was O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
very O -1 5
surprised O -1 5
by O -1 5
how O -1 5

the O -1 5

They O -1 5
even O -1 5
have O -1 5
a O -1 5
section O -1 5
in O -1 5
the O -1 5
menu B-ASP 0 5
called O -1 5
American O -1 5

like O -1 5

sprinkled O -1 5

(the O -1 5

red). O -1 5

They O -1 5

was O -1 5
among O -1 5
the O -1 5
best O -1 5
I O -1 5
have O -1 5
ever O -1 5
had O -1 5
in O -1 5
NYC. O -1 5

Its O -1 5
location O -1 5
is O -1 5
good(1) O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
fact O -1 5
that O -1 5
Hutner O -1 5
College O -1 5
is O -1 5
near O -1 5
and O -1 5
their O -1 5
prices O -1 5
are O -1 5
very O -1 5
reasonable, O -1 5

again(2). O -1 5

Appetizer B-ASP 2 5
are O -1 5

you O -1 5

Unfortunately, O -1 5
the O -1 5

was O -1 5
NOT O -1 5
something O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
worked O -1 5
up O -1 5
about. O -1 5

The O -1 5
cuisine B-ASP 1 5
from O -1 5
what O -1 5
I've O -1 5
gathered O -1 5
is O -1 5
authentic O -1 5
Taiwanese, O -1 5
though O -1 5
its O -1 5
very O -1 5
different O -1 5
from O -1 5
what O -1 5
I've O -1 5
been O -1 5
accustomed O -1 5
to O -1 5
in O -1 5
Taipei. O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
planning O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
dessert B-ASP 1 5
but O -1 5
the O -1 5
waitress O -1 5
basically O -1 5
through O -1 5
the O -1 5
bill O -1 5
at O -1 5
us O -1 5
before O -1 5
we O -1 5
had O -1 5
a O -1 5

to O -1 5
order. O -1 5

Delicious(1) O -1 5

make O -1 5
this O -1 5
a O -1 5
great O -1 5

for O -1 5

and O -1 5
the O -1 5

makes O -1 5
it O -1 5
an O -1 5
even O -1 5
better O -1 5
choice(5) O -1 5
for O -1 5
lunch! O -1 5

I O -1 5
have O -1 5
never O -1 5
better O -1 5
enjoyed O -1 5
humble O -1 5
root O -1 5

or O -1 5
a O -1 5
mushroom O -1 5
consomme O -1 5
- O -1 5
and O -1 5
this O -1 5
chef B-ASP 2 5
accomplishes O -1 5
without O -1 5
fats. O -1 5

They O -1 5
did O -1 5
not O -1 5
have O -1 5
mayonnaise, O -1 5
forgot O -1 5
our O -1 5
toast, O -1 5
left O -1 5
out O -1 5
ingredients O -1 5
(ie O -1 5
cheese O -1 5
in O -1 5
an O -1 5
omelet), B-ASP 1 5
below O -1 5
hot O -1 5
temperatures O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
bacon O -1 5
was O -1 5
so O -1 5
over O -1 5
cooked O -1 5
it O -1 5
crumbled O -1 5
on O -1 5
the O -1 5
plate O -1 5
when O -1 5
you O -1 5
touched O -1 5
it. O -1 5

Food B-ASP 1 5
was O -1 5
okay, O -1 5
nothing O -1 5
great. O -1 5

if O -1 5
this O -1 5
happens, O -1 5
just O -1 5
ask O -1 5
for O -1 5
real O -1 5
naan. B-ASP 1 5

But O -1 5
after O -1 5
last O -1 5
night, O -1 5
Spice O -1 5
Grill O -1 5
is O -1 5
the O -1 5
only O -1 5
place O -1 5
I'm O -1 5
eating O -1 5
indian B-ASP 2 5
cuisine. I-ASP 2 5

The O -1 5
food B-ASP 2 5
was O -1 5
average O -1 5
or O -1 5
above O -1 5
including O -1 5
some O -1 5
surprising O -1 5
tasty O -1 5
dishes. O -1 5

I O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
crab O -1 5
cocktail O -1 5
and O -1 5
it O -1 5
was O -1 5
soaked O -1 5
in O -1 5
a O -1 5
lime O -1 5
juice O -1 5
concoction O -1 5
where O -1 5
all O -1 5
you O -1 5
could O -1 5
taste O -1 5
was O -1 5
the O -1 5
lime. B-ASP 1 5

The O -1 5
boutique B-ASP 1 5
selection I-ASP 1 5
of I-ASP 1 5
wines I-ASP 1 5
covers O -1 5
a O -1 5
wide O -1 5
variety O -1 5
without O -1 5
being O -1 5
imposeing. O -1 5

You O -1 5
must O -1 5
try O -1 5
the O -1 5
garlic B-ASP 2 5
soup! I-ASP 2 5

Although O -1 5
the O -1 5
place B-ASP 3 5
could O -1 5
be O -1 5
a O -1 5
little O -1 5
more O -1 5
eye O -1 5
catching O -1 5
and O -1 5
roomier, O -1 5
at O -1 5
the O -1 5
same O -1 5
time, O -1 5
it O -1 5
doesn't O -1 5
really O -1 5
matter. O -1 5

We O -1 5
ended O -1 5
the O -1 5
dinner O -1 5
with O -1 5
a O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
light O -1 5
and O -1 5
flaky O -1 5
apple B-ASP 2 5
tarte I-ASP 2 5
tatin. I-ASP 2 5

Our O -1 5
server B-ASP 0 5
checked O -1 5
on O -1 5
us O -1 5
maybe O -1 5
twice O -1 5
during O -1 5
the O -1 5
entire O -1 5
meal. O -1 5

The O -1 5
menu O -1 5
is O -1 5
interesting(1) O -1 5
and O -1 5
quite O -1 5
reasonably(2) O -1 5
priced. O -1 5

Even O -1 5
when O -1 5
the O -1 5
chef O -1 5
is O -1 5
not O -1 5
in O -1 5
the O -1 5
house(1), O -1 5
the O -1 5
food O -1 5
and O -1 5
service O -1 5
are O -1 5
right O -1 5
on O -1 5
target(2). O -1 5

We O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
chicken B-ASP 0 5
casserole, I-ASP 0 5
but O -1 5
what O -1 5
we O -1 5
got O -1 5
were O -1 5
a O -1 5
few O -1 5
small O -1 5
pieces O -1 5
of O -1 5
chicken, O -1 5
all O -1 5
dark O -1 5
meat O -1 5
and O -1 5
on O -1 5
the O -1 5
bone. O -1 5

We O -1 5
are O -1 5
very O -1 5
particular O -1 5
about O -1 5
sushi B-ASP 2 5
and O -1 5
were O -1 5
both O -1 5
please O -1 5
with O -1 5
every O -1 5
choice O -1 5
which O -1 5
included: O -1 5
ceviche O -1 5

crab O -1 5
dumplings, O -1 5
assorted O -1 5
sashimi, O -1 5

and O -1 5
rolls, O -1 5
two O -1 5
types O -1 5
of O -1 5
sake, O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
banana O -1 5
tempura. O -1 5

I O -1 5
had O -1 5
been O -1 5
a O -1 5
regular O -1 5
due O -1 5
to O -1 5
the O -1 5
consistently O -1 5
good(1) O -1 5
food O -1 5
and O -1 5
ease(2) O -1 5
of I-ASP 2 5
getting I-ASP 2 5
a I-ASP 2 5
table. O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
still O -1 5
sitting O -1 5
at O -1 5
the O -1 5
bar O -1 5
while O -1 5
we O -1 5
drank O -1 5
the O -1 5
sangria, B-ASP 1 5
but O -1 5
facing O -1 5
away O -1 5
from O -1 5
the O -1 5
bar O -1 5
when O -1 5
we O -1 5
turned O -1 5
back O -1 5
around, O -1 5
the O -1 5

was O -1 5
gone O -1 5
the O -1 5
people O -1 5
next O -1 5
to O -1 5
us O -1 5
said O -1 5
the O -1 5
bartender O -1 5
took O -1 5
it. O -1 5

I O -1 5
live O -1 5
in O -1 5

my O -1 5

with O -1 5
only O -1 5
around O -1 5
15(2) B-ASP 2 5

most. O -1 5

I've O -1 5
had O -1 5
to O -1 5
wait O -1 5
only O -1 5
a O -1 5
few O -1 5
times(1) O -1 5
during O -1 5
lunch O -1 5
but O -1 5
this O -1 5
place O -1 5
is O -1 5
definitely O -1 5
worth(2) O -1 5
the O -1 5
wait. O -1 5

It's O -1 5
constantly O -1 5
open, O -1 5
catering O -1 5
to O -1 5
the O -1 5
Pakistani O -1 5
cabbies O -1 5
lined O -1 5
up O -1 5
on O -1 5
Crosby O -1 5
St., O -1 5
so O -1 5
there's O -1 5
more O -1 5
turnover O -1 5
with O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 2 5
than O -1 5
you'd O -1 5
expect O -1 5
(i.e., O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
fresh). O -1 5

After O -1 5
waiting B-ASP 0 5
for O -1 5
almost O -1 5
an O -1 5
hour(1), O -1 5
the O -1 5
waiter O -1 5
brusquely O -1 5
told O -1 5
us O -1 5
he'd O -1 5
forgotten(2) O -1 5
to O -1 5
give O -1 5
the O -1 5

I O -1 5
thought O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 0 5
isn't O -1 5
cheap O -1 5
at O -1 5
all O -1 5
compared O -1 5

there's O -1 5
still O -1 5
a O -1 5

was O -1 5
among O -1 5
the O -1 5
best O -1 5
I O -1 5
have O -1 5
ever O -1 5
had O -1 5
in O -1 5

The O -1 5
one O -1 5
vegetarian B-ASP 2 5
entree I-ASP 2 5
(Abby's O -1 5
treasure) O -1 5
was O -1 5
actually O -1 5
quite O -1 5
a O -1 5
surprise O -1 5
- O -1 5
it O -1 5
was O -1 5
delicious O -1 5
and O -1 5
had O -1 5
wintermelon O -1 5
covering O -1 5
an O -1 5
assortment O -1 5
of O -1 5
fresh O -1 5
mushrooms O -1 5
and O -1 5

Yes, O -1 5
there O -1 5
might O -1 5
be O -1 5
a O -1 5
wait B-ASP 0 5
if O -1 5
you O -1 5
have O -1 5
no O -1 5

hidden(1) O -1 5

made O -1 5
for O -1 5

good O -1 5
laugh(2). O -1 5

The O -1 5
selection B-ASP 2 5
of I-ASP 2 5

is O -1 5
excellent(1) O -1 5
(I'm O -1 5

me O -1 5
want O -1 5
to O -1 5
gag, O -1 5
the O -1 5

We O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5

The O -1 5

was O -1 5
definitely O -1 5
good(1), O -1 5

when O -1 5
all O -1 5

done, O -1 5
I O -1 5
just O -1 5

We O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
chicken B-ASP 0 5

what O -1 5
we O -1 5
got O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5

to O -1 5

the O -1 5

through O -1 5

Saul B-ASP 1 5

pretty O -1 5
good, O -1 5

definitely O -1 5
not O -1 5

Yes, O -1 5
there O -1 5
might O -1 5
be O -1 5
a O -1 5

you O -1 5

that O -1 5
are O -1 5
affordable O -1 5
and O -1 5
just O -1 5
as O -1 5
yummy. O -1 5

They O -1 5
even O -1 5
have O -1 5
a O -1 5
section O -1 5

I O -1 5
thought O -1 5
the O -1 5

isn't O -1 5
cheap O -1 5
at O -1 5
all O -1 5

than O -1 5

this O -1 5

its O -1 5

The O -1 5
happy O -1 5

is O -1 5
so O -1 5
cheap(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
that O -1 5

not O -1 5
reflect(2) O -1 5
the I-ASP 2 5

All O -1 5
in O -1 5
all O -1 5
the O -1 5
food O -1 5
was O -1 5
above O -1 5

I O -1 5
would O -1 5

they O -1 5

Also, O -1 5
the O -1 5

didn't O -1 5

What O -1 5

our O -1 5

was O -1 5
burned O -1 5
beyond O -1 5

stringy. O -1 5

The O -1 5
steak O -1 5

good, O -1 5
the O -1 5

is O -1 5
good O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5

surprisingly O -1 5
great. O -1 5

The O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
still O -1 5
sitting O -1 5
at O -1 5
the O -1 5
bar B-ASP 1 5
while O -1 5
we O -1 5

but O -1 5
facing O -1 5
away O -1 5
from O -1 5

might O -1 5

all O -1 5

the O -1 5
counter B-ASP 0 5
when O -1 5
you O -1 5

but O -1 5
their O -1 5

says O -1 5
I O -1 5

Good(1), O -1 5

hey, O -1 5

Really O -1 5

noodles O -1 5
for O -1 5
a O -1 5
good(2) O -1 5
price O -1 5
though. O -1 5

We O -1 5
ended O -1 5
the O -1 5
dinner B-ASP 1 5
with O -1 5
a O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
light O -1 5
and O -1 5
flaky O -1 5
apple O -1 5
tarte O -1 5
tatin. O -1 5

Although O -1 5
the O -1 5
place B-ASP 3 5
could O -1 5
be O -1 5
a O -1 5
little O -1 5
more O -1 5
eye O -1 5
catching O -1 5
and O -1 5
roomier, O -1 5
at O -1 5
the O -1 5
same O -1 5
time, O -1 5
it O -1 5
doesn't O -1 5
really O -1 5
matter. O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
planning O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
dessert O -1 5
but O -1 5
the O -1 5
waitress B-ASP 0 5
basically O -1 5
through O -1 5
the O -1 5
bill O -1 5
at O -1 5
us O -1 5
before O -1 5
we O -1 5
had O -1 5
a O -1 5
chance O -1 5
to O -1 5
order. O -1 5

The O -1 5
food O -1 5
was O -1 5
definitely O -1 5
good(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
when O -1 5
all O -1 5
was O -1 5
said O -1 5
and O -1 5
done, O -1 5
I O -1 5
just O -1 5
couldn't O -1 5
justify O -1 5
it(2) O -1 5
for O -1 5
the I-ASP 0 5
price O -1 5
(including O -1 5
2 O -1 5
drinks, O -1 5
$100/person)... O -1 5

Even O -1 5
when O -1 5
the O -1 5
chef B-ASP 1 5
is O -1 5
not O -1 5
in O -1 5
the O -1 5
house(1), O -1 5
the O -1 5

I O -1 5
don't O -1 5
know O -1 5
about O -1 5
you O -1 5

but O -1 5
when O -1 5
I O -1 5
go O -1 5
somewhere O -1 5
to O -1 5
eat O -1 5
I O -1 5
go(1) O -1 5
for O -1 5
the O -1 5

not O -1 5
for O -1 5
the(2) O -1 5

It O -1 5
takes O -1 5
forever O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
a O -1 5
drink B-ASP 1 5
and O -1 5
they O -1 5
almost O -1 5
always O -1 5
forget O -1 5
to O -1 5
bring O -1 5
something O -1 5
(although O -1 5
they O -1 5

this O -1 5

The O -1 5
steak O -1 5
is O -1 5
good, O -1 5
the O -1 5
fish B-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
good O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
sushi O -1 5
was O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
great. O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
very O -1 5
surprised O -1 5
by O -1 5
how O -1 5
good O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 2 5
was O -1 5
on O -1 5
our O -1 5
first O -1 5
visit O -1 5
here O -1 5
on O -1 5
a O -1 5
Sunday O -1 5
night. O -1 5

What O -1 5
came O -1 5
to O -1 5
our O -1 5
table B-ASP 1 5
was O -1 5
burned O -1 5
beyond O -1 5
recognition O -1 5
and O -1 5
stringy. O -1 5

It O -1 5
is O -1 5
set O -1 5
far O -1 5
from O -1 5
the O -1 5
small O -1 5
street O -1 5
it's O -1 5
on, O -1 5
and O -1 5
there O -1 5
is O -1 5
no O -1 5
traffic B-ASP 2 5
noise. I-ASP 2 5

We O -1 5
always O -1 5
get O -1 5
a O -1 5
sampling O -1 5
of O -1 5
appetizers B-ASP 1 5
and O -1 5
share. O -1 5

They O -1 5
even O -1 5
have O -1 5
a O -1 5
section O -1 5
in O -1 5
the O -1 5
menu O -1 5
called O -1 5
American B-ASP 0 5
Chinese I-ASP 0 5
food! I-ASP 0 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
planning O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
dessert O -1 5
but O -1 5
the O -1 5
waitress O -1 5
basically O -1 5
through O -1 5
the O -1 5
bill B-ASP 1 5
at O -1 5
us O -1 5
before O -1 5
we O -1 5
had O -1 5
a O -1 5
chance O -1 5
to O -1 5
order. O -1 5

So O -1 5
I've O -1 5
never O -1 5
actually O -1 5
been O -1 5
to O -1 5
M O -1 5
proper, O -1 5
but O -1 5
I've O -1 5
had O -1 5
it O -1 5
delivered B-ASP 1 5
a O -1 5
few O -1 5
times. O -1 5

The O -1 5
happy O -1 5
hour O -1 5
is O -1 5
so O -1 5
cheap(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
that O -1 5
does O -1 5
not O -1 5
reflect(2) O -1 5
the O -1 5
service O -1 5
or O -1 5
the I-ASP 2 5
atmosphere. O -1 5

Sit O -1 5
back O -1 5
in O -1 5
one O -1 5
of O -1 5
those O -1 5
comfortable O -1 5
chairs. B-ASP 2 5

They O -1 5
make O -1 5
the O -1 5
best O -1 5

We O -1 5
ended O -1 5
the O -1 5
dinner B-ASP 1 5
with O -1 5
a O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
light O -1 5
and O -1 5
flaky O -1 5
apple O -1 5
tarte O -1 5
tatin. O -1 5

Although O -1 5
the O -1 5
place B-ASP 3 5
could O -1 5
be O -1 5
a O -1 5
little O -1 5
more O -1 5
eye O -1 5
catching O -1 5
and O -1 5
roomier, O -1 5
at O -1 5
the O -1 5
same O -1 5
time, O -1 5
it O -1 5
doesn't O -1 5
really O -1 5
matter. O -1 5

I O -1 5
don't O -1 5
know O -1 5
about O -1 5
you O -1 5
guys, O -1 5
but O -1 5
when O -1 5
I O -1 5
go O -1 5
somewhere O -1 5
to O -1 5
eat O -1 5
I O -1 5
go(1) O -1 5
for O -1 5
the O -1 5
food O -1 5
not O -1 5
for O -1 5
the(2) O -1 5
atmosphere. O -1 5

There O -1 5
was O -1 5
a O -1 5
small O -1 5
wait, B-ASP 3 5
but O -1 5
shorter O -1 5
than O -1 5
I O -1 5
expected. O -1 5

What O -1 5
came O -1 5
to O -1 5
our O -1 5
table B-ASP 1 5
was O -1 5
burned O -1 5
beyond O -1 5
recognition O -1 5
and O -1 5

Good(1), O -1 5
because O -1 5
hey, O -1 5
it's O -1 5
more(2) O -1 5
food, O -1 5
but O -1 5
bad(3) O -1 5
because O -1 5

you O -1 5
can O -1 5

smaller(5) O -1 5
so I-ASP 1 5
that O -1 5
each O -1 5

is O -1 5
cheap(6). O -1 5

We O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
chicken O -1 5
casserole, O -1 5
but O -1 5
what O -1 5
we O -1 5
got O -1 5
were O -1 5
a O -1 5

I've O -1 5

The O -1 5
one O -1 5
vegetarian B-ASP 2 5
entree I-ASP 2 5
(Abby's O -1 5
treasure) O -1 5
was O -1 5
actually O -1 5
quite O -1 5
a O -1 5
surprise O -1 5
- O -1 5
it O -1 5
was O -1 5
delicious O -1 5
and O -1 5
had O -1 5
wintermelon O -1 5
covering O -1 5
an O -1 5
assortment O -1 5
of O -1 5
fresh O -1 5
mushrooms O -1 5
and O -1 5
vegetables. O -1 5

We O -1 5
are O -1 5
very O -1 5
particular O -1 5
about O -1 5
sushi O -1 5
and O -1 5
were O -1 5
both O -1 5
please O -1 5
with O -1 5
every O -1 5
choice O -1 5
which O -1 5
included: O -1 5
ceviche O -1 5

(special), O -1 5
crab O -1 5
dumplings, O -1 5
assorted B-ASP 2 5
sashimi, I-ASP 2 5

and O -1 5

two O -1 5
types O -1 5
of O -1 5

and O -1 5
the O -1 5
banana O -1 5
tempura. O -1 5

Yes, O -1 5
there O -1 5
might O -1 5
be O -1 5
a O -1 5
wait B-ASP 0 5
if O -1 5
you O -1 5
have O -1 5
no O -1 5
reservations. O -1 5

Even O -1 5
when O -1 5
the O -1 5
chef O -1 5
is O -1 5
not O -1 5
in O -1 5
the O -1 5
house(1), O -1 5
the O -1 5
food O -1 5
and O -1 5
service O -1 5
are O -1 5
right O -1 5
on O -1 5
target(2). O -1 5

I O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
crab B-ASP 0 5
cocktail I-ASP 0 5
and O -1 5
it O -1 5
was O -1 5
soaked O -1 5
in O -1 5
a O -1 5
lime O -1 5
juice O -1 5
concoction O -1 5
where O -1 5
all O -1 5
you O -1 5
could O -1 5
taste O -1 5
was O -1 5
the O -1 5
lime. O -1 5

I've O -1 5
been O -1 5
here O -1 5
3 O -1 5
times O -1 5
for O -1 5
lunch B-ASP 1 5
and O -1 5
it O -1 5
is O -1 5
one O -1 5
of O -1 5
my O -1 5
favorites O -1 5
in O -1 5
the O -1 5
city. O -1 5

Finally O -1 5
a O -1 5
curry B-ASP 2 5
that O -1 5
I O -1 5
can O -1 5
eat, O -1 5
enjoy O -1 5
and O -1 5
not O -1 5
suffer O -1 5
from O -1 5
gastritis O -1 5
from O -1 5
3 O -1 5
hours O -1 5
later. O -1 5

The O -1 5
food B-ASP 2 5
was O -1 5
average O -1 5
or O -1 5
above O -1 5
including O -1 5
some O -1 5
surprising O -1 5
tasty O -1 5
dishes. O -1 5

Although O -1 5
the O -1 5
place B-ASP 3 5
could O -1 5
be O -1 5
a O -1 5
little O -1 5
more O -1 5
eye O -1 5
catching O -1 5
and O -1 5
roomier, O -1 5
at O -1 5
the O -1 5
same O -1 5
time, O -1 5
it O -1 5
doesn't O -1 5
really O -1 5
matter. O -1 5

They O -1 5
make O -1 5
the O -1 5
best O -1 5
pizza B-ASP 2 5
in O -1 5
New O -1 5
Jersey. O -1 5

The O -1 5
steak O -1 5
is O -1 5
good, O -1 5
the O -1 5
fish B-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
good O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
sushi O -1 5
was O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
great. O -1 5

I O -1 5
asked O -1 5
for O -1 5
an O -1 5
open O -1 5
faced O -1 5
cheese O -1 5
sandwich O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
manager B-ASP 0 5
basically O -1 5
told O -1 5
me O -1 5
to O -1 5
take O -1 5
my O -1 5
business O -1 5
elsewhere! O -1 5

A O -1 5
mix O -1 5
of O -1 5
students O -1 5
and O -1 5
area O -1 5
residents O -1 5
crowd O -1 5
into O -1 5
this O -1 5
narrow, O -1 5
barely O -1 5
there(1) O -1 5
space O -1 5
for O -1 5
its O -1 5
quick, O -1 5
tasty(2) O -1 5

at O -1 5
dirt-cheap(3) O -1 5
prices. O -1 5

We O -1 5
are O -1 5

the O -1 5

I've O -1 5
had O -1 5
to O -1 5
wait O -1 5
only O -1 5
a O -1 5
few O -1 5
times(1) O -1 5
during O -1 5
lunch O -1 5
but O -1 5
this O -1 5
place O -1 5
is O -1 5
definitely O -1 5
worth(2) O -1 5
the O -1 5
wait. O -1 5

Chef B-ASP 2 5
Waldy's O -1 5
always O -1 5
measures O -1 5
up. O -1 5

Get O -1 5
the O -1 5

a O -1 5

for O -1 5
$8 O -1 5
and O -1 5
you're O -1 5
golden. O -1 5

I O -1 5
have O -1 5
never O -1 5
better O -1 5
enjoyed O -1 5

a O -1 5

and O -1 5
this O -1 5
chef O -1 5
accomplishes O -1 5
without O -1 5
fats. O -1 5

Also, O -1 5
the O -1 5
sandwiches B-ASP 0 5
(nearing O -1 5
$7) O -1 5
didn't O -1 5
come O -1 5
with O -1 5
anything O -1 5
like O -1 5

or O -1 5
a O -1 5

most O -1 5

in O -1 5
the O -1 5

I O -1 5
cannot O -1 5
imagine O -1 5
better O -1 5
Indian B-ASP 2 5
food I-ASP 2 5
in O -1 5
all O -1 5
of O -1 5

Good(1), O -1 5
because O -1 5
hey, O -1 5
it's O -1 5
more(2) O -1 5
food, O -1 5
but O -1 5
bad(3) O -1 5

still O -1 5
a O -1 5
large O -1 5

choices. O -1 5

We O -1 5
ended O -1 5
the O -1 5
dinner B-ASP 1 5
with O -1 5
a O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
light O -1 5
and O -1 5
flaky O -1 5
apple O -1 5

tatin. O -1 5

if O -1 5
this O -1 5
happens, O -1 5
just O -1 5
ask O -1 5

real O -1 5
naan. B-ASP 1 5

We O -1 5
are O -1 5
very O -1 5

and O -1 5
the O -1 5

Example O -1 5
is O -1 5
the O -1 5
soup B-ASP 2 5
which O -1 5
was O -1 5
about O -1 5
6 O -1 5
oz O -1 5
for O -1 5
$12 O -1 5

the O -1 5

$12 O -1 5

about O -1 5
1oz. O -1 5

You O -1 5
must O -1 5
try O -1 5
the O -1 5
garlic B-ASP 2 5
soup! I-ASP 2 5

Although O -1 5

Really O -1 5
tasty(1) O -1 5
spring O -1 5
rolls O -1 5
and O -1 5
noodles O -1 5
for O -1 5
a O -1 5
good(2) O -1 5

The O -1 5
happy O -1 5
hour O -1 5
is O -1 5
so O -1 5
cheap(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
that O -1 5
does O -1 5
not O -1 5
reflect(2) O -1 5
the I-ASP 2 5

or O -1 5
the O -1 5

There O -1 5
was O -1 5
a O -1 5
small O -1 5
wait, B-ASP 3 5
but O -1 5
shorter O -1 5
than O -1 5
I O -1 5
expected. O -1 5

They O -1 5
did O -1 5
not O -1 5
have O -1 5

My O -1 5
friend's O -1 5
food B-ASP 0 5
was O -1 5
also O -1 5
the O -1 5
complete O -1 5
opposite O -1 5
of O -1 5

it's O -1 5
supposed O -1 5
to O -1 5
taste O -1 5

(aND O -1 5
look O -1 5

The O -1 5
food O -1 5
was O -1 5
definitely O -1 5
good(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
when O -1 5
all O -1 5
was O -1 5

done, O -1 5
I O -1 5
just O -1 5
couldn't O -1 5

for O -1 5
the I-ASP 0 5

We O -1 5

The O -1 5
menu O -1 5
is O -1 5
interesting(1) O -1 5
and O -1 5
quite O -1 5
reasonably(2) O -1 5
priced. O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
planning O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
dessert B-ASP 1 5
but O -1 5
the O -1 5
waitress O -1 5
basically O -1 5
through O -1 5
the O -1 5
bill O -1 5
at O -1 5
us O -1 5
before O -1 5
we O -1 5
had O -1 5
a O -1 5
chance O -1 5
to O -1 5

The O -1 5
food O -1 5
was O -1 5
definitely O -1 5
good(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
when O -1 5
all O -1 5
was O -1 5
said O -1 5
and O -1 5
done, O -1 5
I O -1 5
just O -1 5
couldn't O -1 5
justify O -1 5
it(2) O -1 5
for O -1 5
the I-ASP 0 5
price O -1 5
(including O -1 5
2 O -1 5
drinks, O -1 5
$100/person)... O -1 5

then O -1 5
she O -1 5
made O -1 5
a O -1 5
fuss O -1 5
about O -1 5
not O -1 5
being O -1 5
able O -1 5
to O -1 5
add O -1 5

The O -1 5
prices O -1 5
are O -1 5
exceptionally O -1 5
reasonable(1) O -1 5
for O -1 5
food O -1 5
of O -1 5
this O -1 5
caliber(2). O -1 5

if O -1 5
this O -1 5
happens, O -1 5
just O -1 5
ask O -1 5
for O -1 5
real O -1 5
naan. B-ASP 1 5

It O -1 5
was O -1 5
pleasantly O -1 5
uncrowded(1), O -1 5
the O -1 5

was O -1 5
delightful(2), O -1 5

the O -1 5
food O -1 5
(from O -1 5

was O -1 5
delectable(4). O -1 5

For O -1 5
the O -1 5
price O -1 5
you O -1 5
pay O -1 5
for O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 0 5
here, O -1 5
you'd O -1 5
expect O -1 5
it O -1 5
to O -1 5
be O -1 5
at O -1 5
least O -1 5
on O -1 5
par O -1 5
with O -1 5
other O -1 5

I've O -1 5
never O -1 5
actually O -1 5
been O -1 5

I've O -1 5

The O -1 5

Also, O -1 5
the O -1 5
sandwiches B-ASP 0 5
(nearing O -1 5

didn't O -1 5
come O -1 5
with O -1 5

for O -1 5
$8 O -1 5
and O -1 5
you're O -1 5
golden. O -1 5

then O -1 5
she O -1 5
made O -1 5
a O -1 5
fuss O -1 5
about O -1 5
not O -1 5
being O -1 5

There O -1 5
was O -1 5
a O -1 5
small O -1 5
wait, B-ASP 3 5

shorter O -1 5
than O -1 5
I O -1 5
expected. O -1 5

The O -1 5
happy O -1 5
hour O -1 5
is O -1 5
so O -1 5
cheap(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
that O -1 5
does O -1 5
not O -1 5
reflect(2) O -1 5
the I-ASP 2 5

the O -1 5

While O -1 5
there's O -1 5
a O -1 5

were O -1 5
very O -1 5

in O -1 5
the O -1 5

hey, O -1 5
it's O -1 5
more(2) O -1 5

more O -1 5

okay, O -1 5
nothing O -1 5

The O -1 5
happy O -1 5

so O -1 5

that O -1 5

not O -1 5
reflect(2) O -1 5
the I-ASP 2 5
service O -1 5
or O -1 5
the O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
still O -1 5
sitting O -1 5
at O -1 5
the O -1 5

while O -1 5
we O -1 5

away O -1 5
from O -1 5

said O -1 5
the O -1 5

took O -1 5
it. O -1 5

then O -1 5
she O -1 5
made O -1 5
a O -1 5
fuss O -1 5
about O -1 5
not O -1 5

They O -1 5
did O -1 5
not O -1 5
have O -1 5
mayonnaise, O -1 5
forgot O -1 5
our O -1 5
toast, B-ASP 0 5
left O -1 5
out O -1 5
ingredients O -1 5
(ie O -1 5
cheese O -1 5

below O -1 5
hot O -1 5

the O -1 5

over O -1 5
cooked O -1 5
it O -1 5
crumbled O -1 5
on O -1 5
the O -1 5

when O -1 5
you O -1 5
touched O -1 5
it. O -1 5

After O -1 5
waiting B-ASP 0 5
for O -1 5
almost O -1 5
an O -1 5
hour(1), O -1 5
the O -1 5
waiter O -1 5
brusquely O -1 5
told O -1 5
us O -1 5
he'd O -1 5
forgotten(2) O -1 5
to O -1 5
give O -1 5
the O -1 5
kitchen O -1 5
our O -1 5
order. O -1 5

We O -1 5
ended O -1 5
the O -1 5
dinner B-ASP 1 5
with O -1 5
a O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
light O -1 5
and O -1 5
flaky O -1 5
apple O -1 5
tarte O -1 5
tatin. O -1 5

It's O -1 5
like O -1 5
they O -1 5
took O -1 5
leftover O -1 5
chicken, O -1 5
poured O -1 5
oil O -1 5
and O -1 5
sprinkled O -1 5
pepper O -1 5
powder O -1 5
over O -1 5
it O -1 5
(the O -1 5

I O -1 5
couldn't O -1 5
believe O -1 5
the O -1 5
food. B-ASP 2 5

While O -1 5
there's O -1 5
a O -1 5
decent(1) O -1 5
menu, O -1 5
it O -1 5
shouldn't O -1 5
take O -1 5

Good(1), O -1 5
because O -1 5
hey, O -1 5
it's O -1 5
more(2) O -1 5
food, O -1 5
but O -1 5
bad(3) O -1 5
because O -1 5
dim O -1 5
sum O -1 5
is O -1 5
supposed O -1 5
to O -1 5
be O -1 5
smaller(4) O -1 5

you O -1 5
can O -1 5

that O -1 5

cheap(6). O -1 5

We O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
chicken O -1 5

but O -1 5
what O -1 5
we O -1 5
got O -1 5
were O -1 5

Yes, O -1 5
there O -1 5
might O -1 5
be O -1 5
a O -1 5
wait O -1 5
if O -1 5
you O -1 5
have O -1 5
no O -1 5
reservations. B-ASP 1 5

I O -1 5
thought O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 0 5
isn't O -1 5
cheap O -1 5
at O -1 5
all O -1 5
compared O -1 5
to O -1 5
Chinatown. O -1 5

It O -1 5
was O -1 5
pleasantly O -1 5
uncrowded(1), O -1 5
the O -1 5
service O -1 5
was O -1 5
delightful(2), O -1 5
the O -1 5
garden O -1 5
adorable(3), O -1 5
the O -1 5
food O -1 5
(from O -1 5
appetizers O -1 5
to O -1 5
entrees) O -1 5
was O -1 5
delectable(4). O -1 5

I O -1 5
had O -1 5
been O -1 5
a O -1 5
regular O -1 5
due O -1 5

After O -1 5
waiting B-ASP 0 5
for O -1 5
almost O -1 5
an O -1 5
hour(1), O -1 5
the O -1 5
waiter O -1 5
brusquely O -1 5
told O -1 5
us O -1 5
he'd O -1 5
forgotten(2) O -1 5
to O -1 5
give O -1 5
the O -1 5
kitchen O -1 5
our O -1 5
order. O -1 5

Really O -1 5
tasty(1) O -1 5
spring O -1 5
rolls O -1 5
and O -1 5
noodles O -1 5
for O -1 5
a O -1 5
good(2) O -1 5
price O -1 5
though. O -1 5

Example O -1 5
is O -1 5
the O -1 5
soup B-ASP 2 5
which O -1 5
was O -1 5
about O -1 5
6 O -1 5
oz O -1 5
for O -1 5
$12 O -1 5
dollars O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
mushrooms O -1 5
where O -1 5
$12 O -1 5
for O -1 5
about O -1 5
1oz. O -1 5

While O -1 5
there's O -1 5
a O -1 5
decent(1) O -1 5
menu, O -1 5
it O -1 5
shouldn't O -1 5
take O -1 5

Why O -1 5
do O -1 5
people O -1 5
rave O -1 5
about O -1 5
the O -1 5
ambience. B-ASP 0 5

I O -1 5
asked O -1 5
for O -1 5
an O -1 5
open B-ASP 1 5
faced I-ASP 1 5
cheese I-ASP 1 5
sandwich I-ASP 1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
manager O -1 5
basically O -1 5
told O -1 5
me O -1 5
to O -1 5
take O -1 5
my O -1 5
business O -1 5
elsewhere! O -1 5

It's O -1 5
like O -1 5
they O -1 5
took O -1 5
leftover O -1 5
chicken, O -1 5
poured O -1 5
oil O -1 5
and O -1 5
sprinkled O -1 5
pepper B-ASP 1 5
powder I-ASP 1 5
over O -1 5
it O -1 5
(the O -1 5
sauce O -1 5
was O -1 5
translucent O -1 5
and O -1 5
red). O -1 5

The O -1 5
steak B-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
good, O -1 5
the O -1 5
fish O -1 5
is O -1 5
good O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
sushi O -1 5
was O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
great. O -1 5

Saul B-ASP 1 5
is O -1 5
pretty O -1 5
good, O -1 5
but O -1 5
definitely O -1 5
not O -1 5
great. O -1 5

The O -1 5
place's O -1 5
decor B-ASP 2 5
and O -1 5
hidden(1) O -1 5
bathrooms O -1 5
made O -1 5
for O -1 5
a O -1 5
good O -1 5
laugh(2). O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
very O -1 5
impressed O -1 5
with O -1 5
the O -1 5
food O -1 5
and O -1 5
value. B-ASP 2 5

You O -1 5
must O -1 5
try O -1 5
the O -1 5
garlic B-ASP 2 5
soup! I-ASP 2 5

The O -1 5
food O -1 5
was O -1 5
definitely O -1 5
good(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
when O -1 5
all O -1 5
was O -1 5
said O -1 5
and O -1 5
done, O -1 5
I O -1 5
just O -1 5
couldn't O -1 5
justify O -1 5
it(2) O -1 5
for O -1 5
the I-ASP 0 5
price O -1 5
(including O -1 5
2 O -1 5
drinks, O -1 5
$100/person)... O -1 5

Even O -1 5
when O -1 5
the O -1 5
chef B-ASP 1 5
is O -1 5
not O -1 5
in O -1 5
the O -1 5
house(1), O -1 5
the O -1 5
food O -1 5
and O -1 5
service O -1 5
are O -1 5
right O -1 5
on O -1 5
target(2). O -1 5

I O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
crab O -1 5
cocktail O -1 5
and O -1 5
it O -1 5
was O -1 5
soaked O -1 5
in O -1 5
a O -1 5
lime O -1 5
juice O -1 5
concoction O -1 5
where O -1 5
all O -1 5
you O -1 5
could O -1 5
taste O -1 5
was O -1 5
the O -1 5
lime. B-ASP 1 5

We O -1 5
always O -1 5
get O -1 5
a O -1 5
sampling O -1 5
of O -1 5
appetizers B-ASP 1 5
and O -1 5
share. O -1 5

The O -1 5
menu O -1 5
is O -1 5
interesting(1) O -1 5
and O -1 5
quite O -1 5
reasonably(2) O -1 5
priced. O -1 5

We O -1 5
are O -1 5
very O -1 5

about O -1 5

were O -1 5
both O -1 5

Not O -1 5
to O -1 5
be O -1 5
overlooked, O -1 5
the O -1 5
service B-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
excellent. O -1 5

The O -1 5
one O -1 5
vegetarian O -1 5

(Abby's O -1 5
treasure) O -1 5
was O -1 5
actually O -1 5
quite O -1 5
a O -1 5
surprise O -1 5
- O -1 5
it O -1 5
was O -1 5
delicious O -1 5
and O -1 5
had O -1 5
wintermelon B-ASP 2 5
covering O -1 5
an O -1 5
assortment O -1 5
of O -1 5

For O -1 5

used O -1 5

Indian B-ASP 2 5
food, I-ASP 2 5
Baluchi's O -1 5
has O -1 5
changed O -1 5
my O -1 5
mid. O -1 5

The O -1 5
food B-ASP 2 5
was O -1 5
average O -1 5
or O -1 5
above O -1 5
including O -1 5
some O -1 5
surprising O -1 5
tasty O -1 5
dishes. O -1 5

It O -1 5
takes O -1 5
forever O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
a O -1 5
drink B-ASP 1 5
and O -1 5
they O -1 5
almost O -1 5
always O -1 5
forget O -1 5
to O -1 5
bring O -1 5
something O -1 5
(although O -1 5
they O -1 5
dont O -1 5
forget O -1 5
to O -1 5

the O -1 5
only O -1 5

I'm O -1 5
eating O -1 5
indian B-ASP 2 5

I O -1 5
had O -1 5
been O -1 5

Service B-ASP 2 5
was O -1 5
among O -1 5
the O -1 5
best O -1 5
I O -1 5
have O -1 5
ever O -1 5
had O -1 5
in O -1 5
NYC. O -1 5

The O -1 5
cuisine B-ASP 1 5
from O -1 5
what O -1 5
I've O -1 5
gathered O -1 5
is O -1 5
authentic O -1 5
Taiwanese, O -1 5
though O -1 5
its O -1 5
very O -1 5
different O -1 5
from O -1 5
what O -1 5
I've O -1 5
been O -1 5
accustomed O -1 5
to O -1 5
in O -1 5
Taipei. O -1 5

then O -1 5
she O -1 5
made O -1 5
a O -1 5
fuss O -1 5
about O -1 5
not O -1 5
being O -1 5
able O -1 5
to O -1 5
add O -1 5

or O -1 5
2 O -1 5

either O -1 5
end O -1 5
of O -1 5
the O -1 5
table B-ASP 1 5
for O -1 5
additional O -1 5
people. O -1 5

For O -1 5
the O -1 5
price O -1 5
you O -1 5
pay O -1 5
for O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 0 5
here, O -1 5
you'd O -1 5
expect O -1 5
it O -1 5
to O -1 5
be O -1 5
at O -1 5
least O -1 5
on O -1 5
par O -1 5
with O -1 5
other O -1 5

Once O -1 5
we O -1 5

the O -1 5
top-notch(1) O -1 5

on O -1 5
a O -1 5

I've O -1 5
had O -1 5
to O -1 5
wait O -1 5
only O -1 5
a O -1 5
few O -1 5
times(1) O -1 5
during O -1 5

this O -1 5

is O -1 5
definitely O -1 5
worth(2) O -1 5
the O -1 5
wait. O -1 5

They O -1 5
did O -1 5
not O -1 5

I O -1 5
don't O -1 5
know O -1 5
about O -1 5
you O -1 5
guys, O -1 5
but O -1 5
when O -1 5
I O -1 5
go O -1 5
somewhere O -1 5
to O -1 5
eat O -1 5
I O -1 5
go(1) O -1 5
for O -1 5
the O -1 5
food O -1 5
not O -1 5
for O -1 5
the(2) O -1 5
atmosphere. O -1 5

Good(1), O -1 5
because O -1 5
hey, O -1 5
it's O -1 5
more(2) O -1 5
food, O -1 5
but O -1 5
bad(3) O -1 5
because O -1 5
dim O -1 5
sum O -1 5
is O -1 5
supposed O -1 5
to O -1 5
be O -1 5
smaller(4) O -1 5
portions O -1 5
so O -1 5
you O -1 5
can O -1 5
try O -1 5
out O -1 5
more O -1 5
dishes O -1 5
and O -1 5
smaller(5) O -1 5
so I-ASP 1 5
that O -1 5
each O -1 5
dish O -1 5
is O -1 5
cheap(6). O -1 5

The O -1 5
portions B-ASP 2 5

large O -1 5

the O -1 5

always O -1 5
surprise O -1 5
us O -1 5
with O -1 5
a O -1 5
different O -1 5

Although O -1 5
the O -1 5
place B-ASP 3 5
could O -1 5
be O -1 5
a O -1 5
little O -1 5
more O -1 5
eye O -1 5
catching O -1 5
and O -1 5
roomier, O -1 5
at O -1 5
the O -1 5
same O -1 5
time, O -1 5
it O -1 5
doesn't O -1 5
really O -1 5
matter. O -1 5

Sit O -1 5

They O -1 5
did O -1 5
not O -1 5

I've O -1 5
never O -1 5

all O -1 5
you O -1 5
could O -1 5
taste O -1 5
was O -1 5
the O -1 5
lime. O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
planning O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
dessert B-ASP 1 5
but O -1 5
the O -1 5
waitress O -1 5
basically O -1 5
through O -1 5
the O -1 5
bill O -1 5
at O -1 5
us O -1 5
before O -1 5
we O -1 5
had O -1 5
a O -1 5
chance O -1 5
to O -1 5
order. O -1 5

The O -1 5
boutique B-ASP 1 5
selection I-ASP 1 5
of I-ASP 1 5
wines I-ASP 1 5
covers O -1 5
a O -1 5
wide O -1 5
variety O -1 5
without O -1 5
being O -1 5
imposeing. O -1 5

The O -1 5
prices O -1 5
are O -1 5
exceptionally O -1 5
reasonable(1) O -1 5
for O -1 5
food O -1 5
of O -1 5
this O -1 5
caliber(2). O -1 5

Example O -1 5
is O -1 5
the O -1 5
soup B-ASP 2 5
which O -1 5
was O -1 5
about O -1 5
6 O -1 5
oz O -1 5
for O -1 5
$12 O -1 5
dollars O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
mushrooms O -1 5
where O -1 5
$12 O -1 5
for O -1 5
about O -1 5
1oz. O -1 5

The O -1 5
food O -1 5
and O -1 5
staff B-ASP 2 5
always O -1 5
surprise O -1 5

with O -1 5
the O -1 5

they O -1 5
are O -1 5
taken O -1 5

The O -1 5
cuisine B-ASP 1 5
from O -1 5
what O -1 5
I've O -1 5
gathered O -1 5
is O -1 5
authentic O -1 5
Taiwanese, O -1 5
though O -1 5
its O -1 5
very O -1 5
different O -1 5
from O -1 5
what O -1 5
I've O -1 5
been O -1 5
accustomed O -1 5
to O -1 5
in O -1 5
Taipei. O -1 5

Even O -1 5
when O -1 5
the O -1 5
chef O -1 5
is O -1 5
not O -1 5
in O -1 5
the O -1 5
house(1), O -1 5
the O -1 5

are O -1 5
right O -1 5
on O -1 5

My O -1 5

took O -1 5
me O -1 5
to O -1 5
Scopa O -1 5
last O -1 5
week O -1 5
for O -1 5
my O -1 5
birthday O -1 5
and O -1 5
I O -1 5
couldn't O -1 5
believe O -1 5
the O -1 5
food. B-ASP 2 5

Its O -1 5
location O -1 5
is O -1 5
good(1) O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
fact O -1 5
that O -1 5
Hutner O -1 5
College O -1 5
is O -1 5
near O -1 5
and O -1 5
their O -1 5
prices O -1 5
are O -1 5
very O -1 5
reasonable, O -1 5
makes O -1 5
students O -1 5
go O -1 5
back O -1 5
to O -1 5
Suan O -1 5
again O -1 5
and O -1 5
again(2). O -1 5

I've O -1 5
been O -1 5
here O -1 5
3 O -1 5
times O -1 5
for O -1 5
lunch B-ASP 1 5
and O -1 5
it O -1 5
is O -1 5
one O -1 5
of O -1 5
my O -1 5
favorites O -1 5
in O -1 5
the O -1 5

Even O -1 5

the O -1 5

the O -1 5

There O -1 5
was O -1 5
a O -1 5
small O -1 5
wait, B-ASP 3 5
but O -1 5
shorter O -1 5
than O -1 5
I O -1 5
expected. O -1 5

They O -1 5
might O -1 5
be O -1 5
all O -1 5

at O -1 5
the O -1 5
counter B-ASP 0 5
when O -1 5
you O -1 5
give O -1 5
your O -1 5

but O -1 5
their O -1 5
food O -1 5
says O -1 5
I O -1 5
love O -1 5
you. O -1 5

We O -1 5
are O -1 5
very O -1 5
particular O -1 5
about O -1 5
sushi O -1 5
and O -1 5
were O -1 5
both O -1 5
please O -1 5
with O -1 5
every O -1 5
choice O -1 5
which O -1 5
included: O -1 5

types O -1 5

and O -1 5
the O -1 5

The O -1 5
steak O -1 5
is O -1 5
good, O -1 5
the O -1 5
fish B-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
good O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
sushi O -1 5
was O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
great. O -1 5

Even O -1 5
when O -1 5
the O -1 5
chef B-ASP 1 5
is O -1 5

the O -1 5

In O -1 5
fact, O -1 5
two O -1 5
people O -1 5
could O -1 5
really O -1 5
share O -1 5
one O -1 5
plate. B-ASP 2 5

The O -1 5
food O -1 5
was O -1 5
definitely O -1 5
good(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
when O -1 5
all O -1 5
was O -1 5
said O -1 5
and O -1 5
done, O -1 5
I O -1 5
just O -1 5
couldn't O -1 5
justify O -1 5
it(2) O -1 5
for O -1 5
the I-ASP 0 5
price O -1 5
(including O -1 5
2 O -1 5
drinks, O -1 5
$100/person)... O -1 5

Why O -1 5
do O -1 5
people O -1 5
rave O -1 5
about O -1 5
the O -1 5

The O -1 5
portions B-ASP 2 5

large O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5

always O -1 5
surprise O -1 5
us O -1 5
with O -1 5
a O -1 5
different O -1 5

So O -1 5
I've O -1 5
never O -1 5
actually O -1 5
been O -1 5
to O -1 5
M O -1 5
proper, O -1 5
but O -1 5
I've O -1 5
had O -1 5
it O -1 5
delivered B-ASP 1 5

After O -1 5
waiting B-ASP 0 5
for O -1 5
almost O -1 5
an O -1 5
hour(1), O -1 5
the O -1 5
waiter O -1 5
brusquely O -1 5
told O -1 5
us O -1 5
he'd O -1 5
forgotten(2) O -1 5
to O -1 5
give O -1 5
the O -1 5

in O -1 5
the O -1 5

It's O -1 5
just O -1 5

nothing O -1 5
more O -1 5

that's O -1 5

the O -1 5

they O -1 5

with O -1 5
four O -1 5

less I-ASP 1 5

It's O -1 5
like O -1 5
they O -1 5
took O -1 5
leftover O -1 5

the I-ASP 2 5

The O -1 5
one O -1 5
vegetarian B-ASP 2 5
entree I-ASP 2 5
(Abby's O -1 5
treasure) O -1 5
was O -1 5
actually O -1 5
quite O -1 5
a O -1 5
surprise O -1 5
- O -1 5
it O -1 5
was O -1 5
delicious O -1 5
and O -1 5
had O -1 5

covering O -1 5
an O -1 5
assortment O -1 5
of O -1 5
fresh O -1 5
mushrooms O -1 5

I O -1 5
asked O -1 5
for O -1 5
an O -1 5
open B-ASP 1 5
faced I-ASP 1 5
cheese I-ASP 1 5
sandwich I-ASP 1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5

basically O -1 5
told O -1 5
me O -1 5
to O -1 5
take O -1 5
my O -1 5
business O -1 5
elsewhere! O -1 5

if O -1 5
this O -1 5
happens, O -1 5
just O -1 5
ask O -1 5
for O -1 5
real O -1 5
naan. B-ASP 1 5

I O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
crab B-ASP 0 5
cocktail I-ASP 0 5
and O -1 5
it O -1 5
was O -1 5
soaked O -1 5
in O -1 5
a O -1 5
lime O -1 5
juice O -1 5
concoction O -1 5
where O -1 5
all O -1 5
you O -1 5

the O -1 5

This O -1 5

has O -1 5
beautiful O -1 5
sushi, B-ASP 2 5
and O -1 5
it's O -1 5
delicious O -1 5
CHEAP. O -1 5

They O -1 5
did O -1 5
not O -1 5
have O -1 5
mayonnaise, O -1 5
forgot O -1 5
our O -1 5

left O -1 5
out O -1 5

below O -1 5
hot O -1 5

and O -1 5
the O -1 5
bacon O -1 5
was O -1 5
so O -1 5
over O -1 5
cooked O -1 5
it O -1 5
crumbled O -1 5
on O -1 5
the O -1 5
plate O -1 5
when O -1 5
you O -1 5
touched O -1 5
it. O -1 5

We O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
chicken O -1 5
casserole, O -1 5
but O -1 5
what O -1 5
we O -1 5
got O -1 5
were O -1 5
a O -1 5

all O -1 5
dark O -1 5

NOT O -1 5

dinner O -1 5
about O -1 5
5:30 O -1 5
on O -1 5
a O -1 5
week O -1 5
night O -1 5
without O -1 5
reservations. B-ASP 1 5

I O -1 5
asked O -1 5
for O -1 5
an O -1 5
open O -1 5
faced O -1 5
cheese O -1 5
sandwich O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
manager B-ASP 0 5
basically O -1 5
told O -1 5
me O -1 5
to O -1 5
take O -1 5
my O -1 5
business O -1 5
elsewhere! O -1 5

Go O -1 5
for O -1 5
the O -1 5
Seafood B-ASP 2 5
Paella I-ASP 2 5
for I-ASP 2 5
two. I-ASP 2 5

Example O -1 5
is O -1 5
the O -1 5
soup O -1 5
which O -1 5
was O -1 5
about O -1 5
6 O -1 5
oz O -1 5
for O -1 5
$12 O -1 5
dollars O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
mushrooms B-ASP 2 5
where O -1 5
$12 O -1 5
for O -1 5
about O -1 5
1oz. O -1 5

It's O -1 5
like O -1 5
they O -1 5
took O -1 5
leftover O -1 5
chicken, O -1 5
poured O -1 5
oil B-ASP 1 5
and O -1 5
sprinkled O -1 5
pepper O -1 5
powder O -1 5
over O -1 5
it O -1 5
(the O -1 5
sauce O -1 5
was O -1 5
translucent O -1 5
and O -1 5
red). O -1 5

Three O -1 5
of O -1 5
us O -1 5
arrived O -1 5
for O -1 5
dinner O -1 5
about O -1 5
5:30 O -1 5
on O -1 5
a O -1 5
week O -1 5
night O -1 5
without O -1 5
reservations. B-ASP 1 5

I O -1 5
thought O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 0 5
isn't O -1 5
cheap O -1 5
at O -1 5
all O -1 5
compared O -1 5
to O -1 5
Chinatown. O -1 5

Good(1), O -1 5
because O -1 5
hey, O -1 5
it's O -1 5
more(2) O -1 5
food, O -1 5
but O -1 5
bad(3) O -1 5
because O -1 5
dim O -1 5
sum O -1 5
is O -1 5
supposed O -1 5
to O -1 5
be O -1 5
smaller(4) O -1 5
portions O -1 5
so O -1 5
you O -1 5
can O -1 5
try O -1 5
out O -1 5
more O -1 5
dishes O -1 5
and O -1 5
smaller(5) O -1 5
so I-ASP 1 5
that O -1 5
each O -1 5
dish O -1 5
is O -1 5
cheap(6). O -1 5

The O -1 5
portions O -1 5
are O -1 5
large O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
servers O -1 5
always O -1 5
surprise O -1 5
us O -1 5
with O -1 5
a O -1 5
different O -1 5
starter. B-ASP 2 5

I O -1 5
asked O -1 5
for O -1 5
an O -1 5
open O -1 5
faced O -1 5
cheese O -1 5
sandwich O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
manager B-ASP 0 5
basically O -1 5
told O -1 5
me O -1 5
to O -1 5
take O -1 5
my O -1 5
business O -1 5
elsewhere! O -1 5

I O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
crab B-ASP 0 5
cocktail I-ASP 0 5
and O -1 5
it O -1 5
was O -1 5
soaked O -1 5
in O -1 5
a O -1 5
lime O -1 5
juice O -1 5
concoction O -1 5
where O -1 5
all O -1 5
you O -1 5
could O -1 5
taste O -1 5
was O -1 5
the O -1 5
lime. O -1 5

Although O -1 5
the O -1 5
place B-ASP 3 5
could O -1 5
be O -1 5
a O -1 5
little O -1 5
more O -1 5
eye O -1 5
catching O -1 5
and O -1 5
roomier, O -1 5
at O -1 5
the O -1 5
same O -1 5
time, O -1 5
it O -1 5
doesn't O -1 5
really O -1 5
matter. O -1 5

The O -1 5
happy O -1 5
hour O -1 5
is O -1 5
so O -1 5
cheap(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
that O -1 5
does O -1 5
not O -1 5
reflect(2) O -1 5
the I-ASP 2 5
service O -1 5
or O -1 5
the O -1 5
atmosphere. O -1 5

It's O -1 5
like O -1 5
they O -1 5
took O -1 5
leftover O -1 5
chicken, O -1 5
poured O -1 5
oil O -1 5
and O -1 5
sprinkled O -1 5

over O -1 5
it O -1 5
(the O -1 5
sauce O -1 5
was O -1 5
translucent O -1 5
and O -1 5
red). O -1 5

This O -1 5
place O -1 5
has O -1 5
beautiful O -1 5
sushi, B-ASP 2 5
and O -1 5
it's O -1 5
delicious O -1 5
CHEAP. O -1 5

I O -1 5
have O -1 5
never O -1 5
better O -1 5

this O -1 5

accomplishes O -1 5
without O -1 5

it O -1 5
an O -1 5

for O -1 5
lunch! O -1 5

The O -1 5
place B-ASP 2 5

clean(1), O -1 5

if O -1 5
you O -1 5
like O -1 5

then O -1 5
this O -1 5
is O -1 5
the O -1 5

We O -1 5
are O -1 5
very O -1 5
particular O -1 5
about O -1 5

were O -1 5
both O -1 5

with O -1 5
every O -1 5

which O -1 5
included: O -1 5

Three O -1 5

about O -1 5
5:30 O -1 5
on O -1 5
a O -1 5

without O -1 5

The O -1 5
steak O -1 5
is O -1 5
good, O -1 5
the O -1 5
fish B-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
good O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
sushi O -1 5
was O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
great. O -1 5

The O -1 5
food O -1 5
was O -1 5
average O -1 5
or O -1 5
above O -1 5
including O -1 5
some O -1 5
surprising O -1 5
tasty O -1 5
dishes. B-ASP 2 5

In O -1 5
fact, O -1 5
two O -1 5
people O -1 5
could O -1 5
really O -1 5
share O -1 5
one O -1 5

I O -1 5
don't O -1 5
know O -1 5
about O -1 5
you O -1 5
guys, O -1 5
but O -1 5
when O -1 5
I O -1 5
go O -1 5
somewhere O -1 5
to O -1 5
eat O -1 5
I O -1 5
go(1) O -1 5
for O -1 5
the O -1 5
food O -1 5
not O -1 5
for O -1 5
the(2) O -1 5
atmosphere. O -1 5

Example O -1 5
is O -1 5
the O -1 5

was O -1 5
about O -1 5
6 O -1 5

the O -1 5

$12 O -1 5
for O -1 5
about O -1 5
1oz. O -1 5

The O -1 5
prices O -1 5
are O -1 5
exceptionally O -1 5
reasonable(1) O -1 5
for O -1 5
food O -1 5
of O -1 5
this O -1 5
caliber(2). O -1 5

It O -1 5
takes O -1 5
forever O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
a O -1 5
drink B-ASP 1 5
and O -1 5
they O -1 5
almost O -1 5
always O -1 5
forget O -1 5
to O -1 5
bring O -1 5
something O -1 5
(although O -1 5
they O -1 5
dont O -1 5
forget O -1 5
to O -1 5
charge O -1 5
you O -1 5
for O -1 5
it. O -1 5

Anywhere O -1 5
else, O -1 5
the O -1 5
prices B-ASP 2 5
would O -1 5
be O -1 5
3x O -1 5

my O -1 5
birthday O -1 5
and O -1 5
I O -1 5
couldn't O -1 5
believe O -1 5
the O -1 5

The O -1 5

Also, O -1 5
the O -1 5

I O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
crab B-ASP 0 5
cocktail I-ASP 0 5
and O -1 5
it O -1 5
was O -1 5
soaked O -1 5

concoction O -1 5
where O -1 5
all O -1 5

taste O -1 5

the O -1 5
lime. O -1 5

Good(1), O -1 5
because O -1 5
hey, O -1 5
it's O -1 5
more(2) O -1 5
food, O -1 5
but O -1 5
bad(3) O -1 5
because O -1 5
dim O -1 5
sum O -1 5
is O -1 5
supposed O -1 5
to O -1 5
be O -1 5
smaller(4) O -1 5
portions O -1 5
so O -1 5
you O -1 5
can O -1 5
try O -1 5
out I-ASP 1 5
more O -1 5
dishes O -1 5
and O -1 5
smaller(5) O -1 5
so O -1 5
that O -1 5
each O -1 5
dish O -1 5
is O -1 5
cheap(6). O -1 5

But O -1 5
after O -1 5
last O -1 5
night, O -1 5
Spice O -1 5
Grill O -1 5
is O -1 5
the O -1 5
only O -1 5
place O -1 5
I'm O -1 5
eating O -1 5
indian B-ASP 2 5
cuisine. I-ASP 2 5

The O -1 5
food O -1 5
was O -1 5
definitely O -1 5
good(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
when O -1 5
all O -1 5
was O -1 5
said O -1 5
and O -1 5
done, O -1 5
I O -1 5
just O -1 5
couldn't O -1 5
justify O -1 5
it(2) O -1 5
for O -1 5
the O -1 5
price O -1 5
(including O -1 5
2 I-ASP 1 5
drinks, O -1 5
$100/person)... O -1 5

The O -1 5
place's O -1 5
decor B-ASP 2 5
and O -1 5
hidden(1) O -1 5
bathrooms O -1 5
made O -1 5
for O -1 5
a O -1 5
good O -1 5
laugh(2). O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
very O -1 5
surprised O -1 5
by O -1 5
how O -1 5
good O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 2 5
was O -1 5
on O -1 5
our O -1 5
first O -1 5

good O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 2 5
was O -1 5

visit O -1 5
here O -1 5
on O -1 5
a O -1 5
Sunday O -1 5
night. O -1 5

The O -1 5
avocado B-ASP 2 5
salad I-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
a O -1 5
personal O -1 5
fave. O -1 5

It O -1 5
was O -1 5
pleasantly O -1 5
uncrowded(1), O -1 5
the O -1 5
service O -1 5
was O -1 5
delightful(2), O -1 5
the O -1 5
garden O -1 5
adorable(3), O -1 5
the O -1 5
food O -1 5
(from O -1 5
appetizers O -1 5
to O -1 5
entrees) O -1 5
was O -1 5
delectable(4). O -1 5

It's O -1 5
like O -1 5
they O -1 5
took O -1 5
leftover O -1 5
chicken, O -1 5
poured O -1 5
oil O -1 5
and O -1 5
sprinkled O -1 5
pepper O -1 5
powder O -1 5
over O -1 5
it O -1 5
(the O -1 5
sauce B-ASP 0 5
was O -1 5
translucent O -1 5
and O -1 5
red). O -1 5

Although O -1 5
the O -1 5
place B-ASP 3 5
could O -1 5
be O -1 5
a O -1 5
little O -1 5
more O -1 5
eye O -1 5
catching O -1 5
and O -1 5
roomier, O -1 5
at O -1 5
the O -1 5
same O -1 5
time, O -1 5
it O -1 5
doesn't O -1 5
really O -1 5
matter. O -1 5

While O -1 5
there's O -1 5
a O -1 5
decent(1) O -1 5
menu, O -1 5
it O -1 5
shouldn't O -1 5
take O -1 5
ten O -1 5
minutes O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
your(2) O -1 5
drinks O -1 5
and O -1 5
45 O -1 5
for(3) O -1 5
a O -1 5
dessert O -1 5
pizza. O -1 5

The O -1 5
happy O -1 5
hour O -1 5
is O -1 5
so O -1 5
cheap(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
that O -1 5
does O -1 5
not O -1 5
reflect(2) O -1 5
the O -1 5
service O -1 5
or O -1 5
the I-ASP 2 5
atmosphere. O -1 5

We O -1 5
ended O -1 5
the O -1 5
dinner B-ASP 1 5
with O -1 5
a O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
light O -1 5
and O -1 5
flaky O -1 5
apple O -1 5
tarte O -1 5
tatin. O -1 5

A O -1 5
mix O -1 5
of O -1 5
students O -1 5
and O -1 5
area O -1 5
residents O -1 5
crowd O -1 5
into O -1 5
this O -1 5
narrow, O -1 5
barely O -1 5
there(1) O -1 5
space O -1 5
for O -1 5
its O -1 5
quick, O -1 5
tasty(2) O -1 5
treats O -1 5
at O -1 5
dirt-cheap(3) O -1 5
prices. O -1 5

Really O -1 5
tasty(1) O -1 5
spring O -1 5
rolls O -1 5
and O -1 5
noodles O -1 5
for O -1 5
a O -1 5
good(2) O -1 5
price O -1 5
though. O -1 5

So O -1 5
I've O -1 5
never O -1 5
actually O -1 5
been O -1 5
to O -1 5
M O -1 5
proper, O -1 5
but O -1 5
I've O -1 5
had O -1 5
it O -1 5
delivered B-ASP 1 5
a O -1 5
few O -1 5
times. O -1 5

Even O -1 5
when O -1 5
the O -1 5
chef O -1 5
is O -1 5
not O -1 5
in O -1 5
the O -1 5
house(1), O -1 5
the O -1 5
food O -1 5
and O -1 5
service O -1 5
are O -1 5
right O -1 5
on O -1 5
target(2). O -1 5

I O -1 5
thought O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 0 5
isn't O -1 5
cheap O -1 5
at O -1 5
all O -1 5
compared O -1 5
to O -1 5
Chinatown. O -1 5

The O -1 5
steak B-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
good, O -1 5
the O -1 5
fish O -1 5
is O -1 5
good O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
sushi O -1 5
was O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
great. O -1 5

For O -1 5
the O -1 5
price O -1 5
you O -1 5
pay O -1 5
for O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 0 5

you'd O -1 5
expect O -1 5
it O -1 5
to O -1 5
be O -1 5
at O -1 5
least O -1 5
on O -1 5
par O -1 5
with O -1 5
other O -1 5

I O -1 5

The O -1 5
one O -1 5
vegetarian O -1 5

(Abby's O -1 5

was O -1 5
actually O -1 5

it O -1 5

I O -1 5
had O -1 5
been O -1 5
a O -1 5
regular O -1 5
due O -1 5
to O -1 5
the O -1 5
consistently O -1 5
good(1) O -1 5
food O -1 5
and O -1 5
ease(2) O -1 5
of I-ASP 2 5
getting I-ASP 2 5
a I-ASP 2 5
table. O -1 5

The O -1 5
food B-ASP 2 5
was O -1 5
average O -1 5
or O -1 5
above O -1 5
including O -1 5
some O -1 5
surprising O -1 5
tasty O -1 5
dishes. O -1 5

The O -1 5
unattractive(1) O -1 5
lighting O -1 5
made O -1 5
me O -1 5
want O -1 5
to O -1 5
gag, O -1 5
the O -1 5
food O -1 5
was O -1 5
overpriced(2), O -1 5
there O -1 5
was O -1 5
the O -1 5

my O -1 5

like O -1 5
it O -1 5
might O -1 5
crawl O -1 5
off O -1 5
the O -1 5

Unfortunately, O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 0 5
was O -1 5
NOT O -1 5
something O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
worked O -1 5
up O -1 5
about. O -1 5

The O -1 5

clean(1), O -1 5

if O -1 5
you O -1 5
like O -1 5

this O -1 5

Also, O -1 5
the O -1 5

didn't O -1 5

basically O -1 5
through O -1 5
the O -1 5

at O -1 5
us O -1 5
before O -1 5
we O -1 5
had O -1 5
a O -1 5
chance O -1 5
to O -1 5
order. O -1 5

We O -1 5
are O -1 5
very O -1 5

just O -1 5

told O -1 5
me O -1 5
to O -1 5
take O -1 5
my O -1 5

We O -1 5
ended O -1 5

There O -1 5

a O -1 5
small O -1 5

but O -1 5
shorter O -1 5
than O -1 5
I O -1 5
expected. O -1 5

Food B-ASP 1 5
was O -1 5
okay, O -1 5
nothing O -1 5
great. O -1 5

The O -1 5

was O -1 5

there's O -1 5
more O -1 5

I O -1 5
don't O -1 5

that's O -1 5

the O -1 5

I O -1 5
thought O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 0 5
isn't O -1 5
cheap O -1 5
at O -1 5
all O -1 5
compared O -1 5

at O -1 5

we O -1 5
had O -1 5
a O -1 5
chance O -1 5
to O -1 5
order. O -1 5

It's O -1 5
like O -1 5
they O -1 5
took O -1 5
leftover O -1 5
chicken, O -1 5
poured O -1 5
oil B-ASP 1 5
and O -1 5
sprinkled O -1 5
pepper O -1 5

over O -1 5
it O -1 5
(the O -1 5
sauce O -1 5
was O -1 5
translucent O -1 5

red). O -1 5

I O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
crab O -1 5

and O -1 5
it O -1 5
was O -1 5
soaked O -1 5
in O -1 5
a O -1 5

concoction O -1 5
where O -1 5
all O -1 5
you O -1 5
could O -1 5
taste O -1 5

the O -1 5
lime. B-ASP 1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
planning O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
dessert O -1 5
but O -1 5
the O -1 5
waitress B-ASP 0 5
basically O -1 5
through O -1 5
the O -1 5
bill O -1 5
at O -1 5
us O -1 5
before O -1 5
we O -1 5
had O -1 5
a O -1 5
chance O -1 5
to O -1 5
order. O -1 5

We O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
chicken B-ASP 0 5
casserole, I-ASP 0 5
but O -1 5
what O -1 5
we O -1 5
got O -1 5
were O -1 5
a O -1 5
few O -1 5
small O -1 5
pieces O -1 5
of O -1 5
chicken, O -1 5
all O -1 5
dark O -1 5

and O -1 5
on O -1 5
the O -1 5

Next O -1 5

we O -1 5
wouldn't O -1 5
dare O -1 5
ordering O -1 5

it's O -1 5
supposed O -1 5
to O -1 5
taste O -1 5

We O -1 5
are O -1 5
very O -1 5

about O -1 5

were O -1 5

the O -1 5

told O -1 5
me O -1 5
to O -1 5
take O -1 5

There O -1 5
was O -1 5
a O -1 5

shorter O -1 5

I O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5

A O -1 5

Finally O -1 5
a O -1 5

that O -1 5
I O -1 5

Our O -1 5

We O -1 5
are O -1 5

I've O -1 5

only O -1 5
a O -1 5
few O -1 5

during O -1 5

but O -1 5
this O -1 5
place O -1 5
is O -1 5
definitely O -1 5
worth(2) O -1 5
the O -1 5
wait. O -1 5

Anywhere O -1 5
else, O -1 5
the O -1 5

would O -1 5
be O -1 5
3x O -1 5

I've O -1 5
been O -1 5

3 O -1 5

one O -1 5

my O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
planning O -1 5
to O -1 5

the O -1 5

basically O -1 5
through O -1 5
the O -1 5

at O -1 5

we O -1 5
had O -1 5

It's O -1 5

The O -1 5

average O -1 5
or O -1 5
above O -1 5

some O -1 5
surprising O -1 5

This O -1 5

has O -1 5
beautiful O -1 5

it's O -1 5
delicious O -1 5

The O -1 5
one O -1 5

to O -1 5

They O -1 5
did O -1 5

The O -1 5

are O -1 5
exceptionally O -1 5
reasonable(1) O -1 5
for O -1 5

The O -1 5

more O -1 5

actually O -1 5

it O -1 5
was O -1 5

covering O -1 5
an O -1 5
assortment O -1 5

I O -1 5
have O -1 5
never O -1 5

enjoyed O -1 5

this O -1 5

This O -1 5

beautiful O -1 5

it's O -1 5
delicious O -1 5
CHEAP. O -1 5

I O -1 5
don't O -1 5
know O -1 5
about O -1 5
you O -1 5
guys, O -1 5
but O -1 5
when O -1 5
I O -1 5
go O -1 5
somewhere O -1 5
to O -1 5
eat O -1 5
I O -1 5
go(1) O -1 5
for O -1 5
the O -1 5
food O -1 5
not O -1 5
for O -1 5
the(2) O -1 5
atmosphere. O -1 5

Get O -1 5

a O -1 5

for O -1 5
$8 O -1 5
and O -1 5
you're O -1 5
golden. O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
very O -1 5
surprised O -1 5
by O -1 5
how O -1 5
good O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 2 5
was O -1 5
on O -1 5
our O -1 5
first O -1 5
visit O -1 5
here O -1 5
on O -1 5
a O -1 5
Sunday O -1 5
night. O -1 5

Emilio, O -1 5
the O -1 5
owner, B-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
often O -1 5
sitting O -1 5
in O -1 5
the O -1 5
front O -1 5
table O -1 5
greeting O -1 5
guests O -1 5
as O -1 5
they O -1 5
come O -1 5
and O -1 5
go. O -1 5

Even O -1 5
when O -1 5
the O -1 5
chef O -1 5
is O -1 5
not O -1 5
in O -1 5
the O -1 5
house(1), O -1 5
the O -1 5
food O -1 5
and O -1 5
service O -1 5
are O -1 5
right O -1 5
on O -1 5
target(2). O -1 5

then O -1 5
she O -1 5
made O -1 5
a O -1 5
fuss O -1 5
about O -1 5
not O -1 5
being O -1 5
able O -1 5
to O -1 5
add O -1 5
1 O -1 5
or O -1 5
2 O -1 5
chairs B-ASP 1 5
on O -1 5
either O -1 5
end O -1 5
of O -1 5
the O -1 5
table O -1 5
for O -1 5
additional O -1 5
people. O -1 5

I O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
crab O -1 5
cocktail O -1 5
and O -1 5
it O -1 5
was O -1 5
soaked O -1 5
in O -1 5
a O -1 5
lime B-ASP 1 5
juice I-ASP 1 5
concoction I-ASP 1 5
where O -1 5
all O -1 5
you O -1 5
could O -1 5
taste O -1 5
was O -1 5
the O -1 5
lime. O -1 5

I O -1 5
had O -1 5
been O -1 5
a O -1 5
regular O -1 5
due O -1 5
to O -1 5
the O -1 5
consistently O -1 5
good(1) O -1 5
food O -1 5
and O -1 5
ease(2) O -1 5
of I-ASP 2 5
getting I-ASP 2 5
a I-ASP 2 5
table. O -1 5

The O -1 5
food O -1 5
and O -1 5
staff B-ASP 2 5
always O -1 5
surprise O -1 5
me O -1 5
with O -1 5
the O -1 5
new O -1 5
heights O -1 5
they O -1 5
are O -1 5
taken O -1 5
to. O -1 5

So O -1 5
I've O -1 5
never O -1 5
actually O -1 5
been O -1 5
to O -1 5
M O -1 5
proper, O -1 5
but O -1 5
I've O -1 5
had O -1 5
it O -1 5
delivered B-ASP 1 5
a O -1 5
few O -1 5
times. O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
planning O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
dessert O -1 5
but O -1 5
the O -1 5
waitress B-ASP 0 5
basically O -1 5
through O -1 5
the O -1 5
bill O -1 5
at O -1 5
us O -1 5
before O -1 5
we O -1 5
had O -1 5
a O -1 5
chance O -1 5
to O -1 5
order. O -1 5

I O -1 5
thought O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 0 5
isn't O -1 5
cheap O -1 5
at O -1 5
all O -1 5
compared O -1 5
to O -1 5
Chinatown. O -1 5

Did O -1 5
I O -1 5
mention O -1 5
that O -1 5
the O -1 5
coffee B-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
OUTSTANDING? O -1 5

Delicious(1) O -1 5
food, O -1 5
excellent(2) O -1 5
service, O -1 5
and O -1 5
a O -1 5
pretty(3) O -1 5
atmosphere O -1 5
make O -1 5
this O -1 5
a O -1 5
great O -1 5
choice(4) O -1 5
for O -1 5
dinner O -1 5
and O -1 5
the I-ASP 2 5
$5.99 I-ASP 2 5
lunch O -1 5
buffet O -1 5
makes O -1 5
it O -1 5
an O -1 5
even O -1 5
better O -1 5
choice(5) O -1 5
for O -1 5
lunch! O -1 5

Example O -1 5
is O -1 5
the O -1 5
soup O -1 5
which O -1 5
was O -1 5
about O -1 5
6 O -1 5
oz O -1 5
for O -1 5
$12 O -1 5
dollars O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
mushrooms B-ASP 2 5
where O -1 5
$12 O -1 5
for O -1 5
about O -1 5
1oz. O -1 5

My O -1 5
fiance O -1 5
took O -1 5
me O -1 5
to O -1 5
Scopa O -1 5
last O -1 5
week O -1 5
for O -1 5
my O -1 5
birthday O -1 5
and O -1 5
I O -1 5
couldn't O -1 5
believe O -1 5
the O -1 5
food. B-ASP 2 5

Anywhere O -1 5
else, O -1 5
the O -1 5
prices B-ASP 2 5
would O -1 5
be O -1 5
3x O -1 5
as O -1 5
high! O -1 5

What O -1 5
came O -1 5
to O -1 5
our O -1 5
table B-ASP 1 5
was O -1 5
burned O -1 5
beyond O -1 5

and O -1 5
stringy. O -1 5

We O -1 5
ended O -1 5
the O -1 5

a O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5

Did O -1 5
I O -1 5
mention O -1 5
that O -1 5
the O -1 5
coffee B-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
OUTSTANDING? O -1 5

Example O -1 5
is O -1 5
the O -1 5
soup B-ASP 2 5
which O -1 5
was O -1 5
about O -1 5
6 O -1 5

the O -1 5

$12 O -1 5
for O -1 5
about O -1 5
1oz. O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
planning O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
dessert O -1 5
but O -1 5
the O -1 5
waitress B-ASP 0 5
basically O -1 5
through O -1 5
the O -1 5

at O -1 5

before O -1 5
we O -1 5
had O -1 5
a O -1 5
chance O -1 5
to O -1 5
order. O -1 5

The O -1 5
food O -1 5
and O -1 5
staff B-ASP 2 5
always O -1 5
surprise O -1 5
me O -1 5
with O -1 5
the O -1 5
new O -1 5
heights O -1 5
they O -1 5
are O -1 5
taken O -1 5

the O -1 5
only O -1 5

eating O -1 5
indian B-ASP 2 5

The O -1 5
menu O -1 5
is O -1 5
interesting(1) O -1 5
and O -1 5
quite O -1 5
reasonably(2) O -1 5

Not O -1 5
to O -1 5
be O -1 5
overlooked, O -1 5
the O -1 5
service B-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
excellent. O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
very O -1 5
surprised O -1 5
by O -1 5
how O -1 5
good O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 2 5
was O -1 5
on O -1 5
our O -1 5
first O -1 5

the O -1 5

$12 O -1 5

about O -1 5

The O -1 5
steak B-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
good, O -1 5
the O -1 5
fish O -1 5
is O -1 5
good O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
sushi O -1 5
was O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
great. O -1 5

Finally O -1 5
a O -1 5

We O -1 5

We O -1 5

hey, O -1 5
it's O -1 5
more(2) O -1 5

Not O -1 5

Emilio, O -1 5

Even O -1 5
when O -1 5

the O -1 5

The O -1 5

(I'm O -1 5

So O -1 5
I've O -1 5
never O -1 5
actually O -1 5
been O -1 5
to O -1 5
M O -1 5
proper, O -1 5
but O -1 5
I've O -1 5
had O -1 5
it O -1 5
delivered B-ASP 1 5
a O -1 5
few O -1 5
times. O -1 5

The O -1 5
steak O -1 5
is O -1 5
good, O -1 5
the O -1 5
fish B-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
good O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
sushi O -1 5
was O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
great. O -1 5

For O -1 5
the O -1 5
price O -1 5
you O -1 5
pay O -1 5
for O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 0 5
here, O -1 5
you'd O -1 5
expect O -1 5
it O -1 5
to O -1 5
be O -1 5
at O -1 5
least O -1 5
on O -1 5
par O -1 5
with O -1 5
other O -1 5
Japanese O -1 5
restaurants. O -1 5

We O -1 5
are O -1 5
very O -1 5
particular O -1 5
about O -1 5
sushi O -1 5
and O -1 5
were O -1 5
both O -1 5
please O -1 5
with O -1 5
every O -1 5
choice O -1 5
which O -1 5
included: O -1 5
ceviche B-ASP 2 5
mix I-ASP 2 5
(special), I-ASP 2 5
crab O -1 5
dumplings, O -1 5
assorted O -1 5

and O -1 5

two O -1 5
types O -1 5
of O -1 5
sake, O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
banana O -1 5
tempura. O -1 5

The O -1 5
place B-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
clean(1), O -1 5
and O -1 5
if O -1 5
you O -1 5
like O -1 5
soul O -1 5
food, O -1 5
then O -1 5
this O -1 5
is O -1 5
the O -1 5
place O -1 5
to O -1 5
be!(2) O -1 5

There O -1 5
was O -1 5
a O -1 5
small O -1 5
wait, B-ASP 3 5
but O -1 5
shorter O -1 5
than O -1 5
I O -1 5
expected. O -1 5

It's O -1 5
constantly O -1 5
open, O -1 5
catering O -1 5
to O -1 5
the O -1 5
Pakistani O -1 5
cabbies O -1 5
lined O -1 5
up O -1 5
on O -1 5
Crosby O -1 5
St., O -1 5
so O -1 5
there's O -1 5
more O -1 5
turnover O -1 5
with O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 2 5
than O -1 5
you'd O -1 5
expect O -1 5
(i.e., O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
fresh). O -1 5

It O -1 5
takes O -1 5
forever O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
a O -1 5
drink B-ASP 1 5
and O -1 5
they O -1 5
almost O -1 5
always O -1 5
forget O -1 5
to O -1 5
bring O -1 5
something O -1 5
(although O -1 5
they O -1 5
dont O -1 5
forget O -1 5
to O -1 5
charge O -1 5
you O -1 5
for O -1 5
it. O -1 5

It's O -1 5
like O -1 5
they O -1 5
took O -1 5
leftover O -1 5
chicken, O -1 5
poured O -1 5
oil B-ASP 1 5
and O -1 5
sprinkled O -1 5
pepper O -1 5
powder O -1 5
over O -1 5
it O -1 5
(the O -1 5
sauce O -1 5
was O -1 5
translucent O -1 5
and O -1 5
red). O -1 5

They O -1 5
did O -1 5
not O -1 5
have O -1 5
mayonnaise, O -1 5
forgot O -1 5
our O -1 5
toast, O -1 5
left O -1 5
out O -1 5
ingredients O -1 5
(ie O -1 5
cheese O -1 5
in O -1 5
an O -1 5
omelet), O -1 5
below O -1 5
hot O -1 5
temperatures O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
bacon B-ASP 0 5
was O -1 5
so O -1 5
over O -1 5
cooked O -1 5
it O -1 5
crumbled O -1 5
on O -1 5
the O -1 5
plate O -1 5
when O -1 5
you O -1 5
touched O -1 5
it. O -1 5

I O -1 5
don't O -1 5
know O -1 5
about O -1 5
you O -1 5
guys, O -1 5
but O -1 5
when O -1 5
I O -1 5

I O -1 5
go(1) O -1 5
for O -1 5

not O -1 5

The O -1 5
happy O -1 5
hour O -1 5
is O -1 5
so O -1 5
cheap(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
that O -1 5

nothing O -1 5

I O -1 5
thought O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 0 5
isn't O -1 5
cheap O -1 5
at O -1 5
all O -1 5
compared O -1 5
to O -1 5
Chinatown. O -1 5

Its O -1 5
location O -1 5
is O -1 5
good(1) O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
fact O -1 5
that O -1 5
Hutner O -1 5

near O -1 5
and O -1 5
their O -1 5
prices O -1 5
are O -1 5

go O -1 5
back O -1 5
to O -1 5
Suan O -1 5
again O -1 5
and O -1 5
again(2). O -1 5

They O -1 5

My O -1 5

took O -1 5
me O -1 5
to O -1 5
Scopa O -1 5
last O -1 5
week O -1 5

my O -1 5

and O -1 5
I O -1 5
couldn't O -1 5
believe O -1 5
the O -1 5
food. B-ASP 2 5

then O -1 5
she O -1 5
made O -1 5
a O -1 5
fuss O -1 5
about O -1 5
not O -1 5
being O -1 5
able O -1 5
to O -1 5
add O -1 5

the O -1 5

The O -1 5
prices O -1 5
are O -1 5
exceptionally O -1 5
reasonable(1) O -1 5
for O -1 5
food O -1 5
of O -1 5
this O -1 5
caliber(2). O -1 5

The O -1 5
cuisine B-ASP 1 5
from O -1 5
what O -1 5
I've O -1 5
gathered O -1 5
is O -1 5
authentic O -1 5
Taiwanese, O -1 5
though O -1 5
its O -1 5
very O -1 5
different O -1 5
from O -1 5
what O -1 5
I've O -1 5
been O -1 5
accustomed O -1 5
to O -1 5
in O -1 5
Taipei. O -1 5

While O -1 5
there's O -1 5
a O -1 5
decent(1) O -1 5
menu, O -1 5
it O -1 5
shouldn't O -1 5
take O -1 5
ten O -1 5
minutes O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5

drinks O -1 5
and O -1 5
45 O -1 5
for(3) B-ASP 1 5
a I-ASP 1 5
dessert O -1 5
pizza. O -1 5

I O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
crab O -1 5
cocktail O -1 5
and O -1 5
it O -1 5
was O -1 5
soaked O -1 5
in O -1 5
a O -1 5
lime B-ASP 1 5
juice I-ASP 1 5
concoction I-ASP 1 5
where O -1 5
all O -1 5
you O -1 5
could O -1 5
taste O -1 5
was O -1 5
the O -1 5
lime. O -1 5

It's O -1 5
constantly O -1 5
open, O -1 5

Pakistani O -1 5
cabbies O -1 5
lined O -1 5
up O -1 5
on O -1 5
Crosby O -1 5

so O -1 5
there's O -1 5
more O -1 5
turnover O -1 5
with O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 2 5
than O -1 5
you'd O -1 5
expect O -1 5
(i.e., O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
fresh). O -1 5

ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
chicken O -1 5

but O -1 5
what O -1 5
we O -1 5
got O -1 5

The O -1 5

just O -1 5

I O -1 5
mention O -1 5
that O -1 5
the O -1 5

Service B-ASP 2 5
was O -1 5
among O -1 5
the O -1 5
best O -1 5
I O -1 5
have O -1 5
ever O -1 5
had O -1 5
in O -1 5
NYC. O -1 5

The O -1 5
portions B-ASP 2 5
are O -1 5
large O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
servers O -1 5
always O -1 5
surprise O -1 5
us O -1 5
with O -1 5
a O -1 5
different O -1 5
starter. O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
still O -1 5
sitting O -1 5
at O -1 5
the O -1 5
bar O -1 5
while O -1 5
we O -1 5
drank O -1 5
the O -1 5
sangria, B-ASP 1 5
but O -1 5
facing O -1 5
away O -1 5
from O -1 5
the O -1 5
bar O -1 5
when O -1 5
we O -1 5
turned O -1 5
back O -1 5
around, O -1 5
the O -1 5

was O -1 5
gone O -1 5
the O -1 5

next O -1 5

the O -1 5

took O -1 5
it. O -1 5

This O -1 5

has O -1 5
beautiful O -1 5

it's O -1 5
delicious O -1 5
CHEAP. O -1 5

For O -1 5
the O -1 5
price B-ASP 0 5
you O -1 5
pay O -1 5
for O -1 5
the O -1 5
food O -1 5
here, O -1 5
you'd O -1 5
expect O -1 5
it O -1 5
to O -1 5
be O -1 5
at O -1 5
least O -1 5
on O -1 5
par O -1 5
with O -1 5
other O -1 5
Japanese O -1 5
restaurants. O -1 5

Anywhere O -1 5
else, O -1 5
the O -1 5
prices B-ASP 2 5
would O -1 5
be O -1 5
3x O -1 5
as O -1 5
high! O -1 5

They O -1 5
even O -1 5
have O -1 5
a O -1 5
section O -1 5
in O -1 5
the O -1 5
menu B-ASP 0 5
called O -1 5
American O -1 5
Chinese O -1 5
food! O -1 5

Good(1), O -1 5
because O -1 5
hey, O -1 5
it's O -1 5
more(2) O -1 5
food, O -1 5
but O -1 5
bad(3) O -1 5
because O -1 5
dim O -1 5
sum O -1 5
is O -1 5
supposed O -1 5
to O -1 5
be O -1 5
smaller(4) O -1 5
portions O -1 5
so O -1 5
you O -1 5
can O -1 5
try O -1 5
out O -1 5
more O -1 5
dishes O -1 5
and O -1 5
smaller(5) O -1 5
so I-ASP 1 5
that O -1 5
each O -1 5
dish O -1 5
is O -1 5
cheap(6). O -1 5

I O -1 5
had O -1 5

of I-ASP 2 5
getting I-ASP 2 5

Next O -1 5

we O -1 5
wouldn't O -1 5
dare O -1 5
ordering O -1 5

other O -1 5

I O -1 5
thought O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 0 5
isn't O -1 5
cheap O -1 5
at O -1 5
all O -1 5
compared O -1 5

We O -1 5
ended O -1 5

The O -1 5

what O -1 5
I've O -1 5
gathered O -1 5
is O -1 5
authentic O -1 5
Taiwanese, O -1 5
though O -1 5
its O -1 5
very O -1 5
different O -1 5
from O -1 5
what O -1 5
I've O -1 5
been O -1 5
accustomed O -1 5
to O -1 5
in O -1 5
Taipei. O -1 5

that O -1 5
Hutner O -1 5

their O -1 5

planning O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
dessert O -1 5
but O -1 5
the O -1 5

through O -1 5

The O -1 5
one O -1 5

(Abby's B-ASP 2 5

- O -1 5
it O -1 5

an O -1 5
assortment O -1 5
of O -1 5
fresh O -1 5
mushrooms O -1 5

It's O -1 5
like O -1 5
they O -1 5
took O -1 5
leftover O -1 5
chicken, O -1 5
poured O -1 5
oil B-ASP 1 5

hey, O -1 5
it's O -1 5

this O -1 5

What O -1 5
came O -1 5
to O -1 5
our O -1 5
table B-ASP 1 5
was O -1 5
burned O -1 5

We O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5

what O -1 5
we O -1 5
got O -1 5
were O -1 5

was O -1 5
a O -1 5

The O -1 5
food B-ASP 2 5

the O -1 5
food O -1 5
(from O -1 5

was O -1 5
delectable(4). O -1 5

I O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
crab O -1 5
cocktail O -1 5
and O -1 5
it O -1 5
was O -1 5
soaked O -1 5
in O -1 5
a O -1 5

juice I-ASP 1 5
concoction I-ASP 1 5
where O -1 5
all O -1 5

taste O -1 5
was O -1 5
the O -1 5

The O -1 5
unattractive(1) O -1 5

made O -1 5
me O -1 5
want O -1 5
to O -1 5
gag, O -1 5
the O -1 5
food O -1 5
was O -1 5
overpriced(2), O -1 5
there O -1 5
was O -1 5
the O -1 5
most O -1 5
awful(3) O -1 5
disco O -1 5

performing-and O -1 5
my O -1 5
escargot O -1 5
looked O -1 5
like O -1 5
it O -1 5
might O -1 5
crawl O -1 5
off O -1 5
the O -1 5

The O -1 5
avocado B-ASP 2 5

a O -1 5

never O -1 5

(Abby's B-ASP 2 5

actually O -1 5
quite O -1 5
a O -1 5

- O -1 5
it O -1 5
was O -1 5
delicious O -1 5
and O -1 5
had O -1 5

covering O -1 5
an O -1 5
assortment O -1 5
of O -1 5
fresh O -1 5

and O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
still O -1 5
sitting O -1 5
at O -1 5
the O -1 5
bar B-ASP 1 5
while O -1 5
we O -1 5

but O -1 5
facing O -1 5

it's O -1 5

The O -1 5
unattractive(1) O -1 5

made O -1 5
me O -1 5
want O -1 5

the O -1 5

The O -1 5
happy O -1 5

so O -1 5
cheap(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
that O -1 5
does O -1 5
not O -1 5
reflect(2) O -1 5
the I-ASP 2 5

the O -1 5

The O -1 5

hey, O -1 5

I O -1 5
had O -1 5
been O -1 5

The O -1 5

when O -1 5
all O -1 5
was O -1 5

done, O -1 5
I O -1 5
just O -1 5
couldn't O -1 5

East O -1 5

Did O -1 5

mention O -1 5
that O -1 5

great(1), O -1 5
my O -1 5
soup O -1 5
always O -1 5
arrives O -1 5
nice O -1 5
and O -1 5
hot(2). O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
very O -1 5
surprised O -1 5
by O -1 5
how O -1 5
good O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 2 5
was O -1 5
on O -1 5
our O -1 5
first O -1 5
visit O -1 5
here O -1 5
on O -1 5
a O -1 5
Sunday O -1 5
night. O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
still O -1 5
sitting O -1 5
at O -1 5
the O -1 5
bar B-ASP 1 5
while O -1 5
we O -1 5
drank O -1 5
the O -1 5
sangria, O -1 5
but O -1 5
facing O -1 5
away O -1 5
from O -1 5
the O -1 5
bar O -1 5
when O -1 5
we O -1 5
turned O -1 5
back O -1 5
around, O -1 5
the O -1 5
$2 O -1 5
was O -1 5
gone O -1 5
the O -1 5
people O -1 5
next O -1 5
to O -1 5
us O -1 5
said O -1 5
the O -1 5
bartender O -1 5
took O -1 5
it. O -1 5

The O -1 5
steak O -1 5
is O -1 5
good, O -1 5
the O -1 5
fish O -1 5
is O -1 5
good O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
sushi B-ASP 2 5
was O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
great. O -1 5

Although O -1 5
the O -1 5
place B-ASP 3 5
could O -1 5
be O -1 5
a O -1 5
little O -1 5
more O -1 5
eye O -1 5
catching O -1 5
and O -1 5
roomier, O -1 5
at O -1 5
the O -1 5
same O -1 5
time, O -1 5
it O -1 5
doesn't O -1 5
really O -1 5
matter. O -1 5

Meat B-ASP 1 5
dishes I-ASP 1 5
now O -1 5
adorn O -1 5
the O -1 5
selections, O -1 5
although O -1 5
there's O -1 5
still O -1 5
a O -1 5
large O -1 5
number O -1 5
of O -1 5
vegetarian-friendly O -1 5
choices. O -1 5

then O -1 5
she O -1 5
made O -1 5
a O -1 5
fuss O -1 5
about O -1 5
not O -1 5
being O -1 5
able O -1 5
to O -1 5
add O -1 5

or O -1 5

either O -1 5
end O -1 5
of O -1 5
the O -1 5
table B-ASP 1 5
for O -1 5
additional O -1 5
people. O -1 5

We O -1 5
ended O -1 5
the O -1 5
dinner O -1 5
with O -1 5
a O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
light O -1 5
and O -1 5
flaky O -1 5
apple B-ASP 2 5
tarte I-ASP 2 5
tatin. I-ASP 2 5

Yes, O -1 5
there O -1 5
might O -1 5
be O -1 5
a O -1 5
wait B-ASP 0 5
if O -1 5
you O -1 5
have O -1 5
no O -1 5
reservations. O -1 5

After O -1 5
waiting B-ASP 0 5
for O -1 5
almost O -1 5
an O -1 5
hour(1), O -1 5
the O -1 5
waiter O -1 5
brusquely O -1 5
told O -1 5
us O -1 5
he'd O -1 5
forgotten(2) O -1 5
to O -1 5
give O -1 5
the O -1 5
kitchen O -1 5
our O -1 5
order. O -1 5

Yes, O -1 5
there O -1 5
might O -1 5

if O -1 5
you O -1 5
have O -1 5

It O -1 5
takes O -1 5
forever O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
a O -1 5
drink B-ASP 1 5
and O -1 5
they O -1 5
almost O -1 5
always O -1 5
forget O -1 5
to O -1 5
bring O -1 5
something O -1 5
(although O -1 5
they O -1 5
dont O -1 5
forget O -1 5
to O -1 5
charge O -1 5
you O -1 5
for O -1 5
it. O -1 5

I O -1 5
have O -1 5
never O -1 5
better O -1 5
enjoyed O -1 5

a O -1 5

- O -1 5
and O -1 5
this O -1 5
chef B-ASP 2 5
accomplishes O -1 5
without O -1 5
fats. O -1 5

The O -1 5
steak B-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
good, O -1 5
the O -1 5
fish O -1 5
is O -1 5
good O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
sushi O -1 5
was O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
great. O -1 5

The O -1 5
food O -1 5
was O -1 5
definitely O -1 5
good(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
when O -1 5
all O -1 5
was O -1 5
said O -1 5
and O -1 5
done, O -1 5
I O -1 5
just O -1 5
couldn't O -1 5
justify O -1 5
it(2) O -1 5
for O -1 5
the I-ASP 0 5
price O -1 5
(including O -1 5
2 O -1 5
drinks, O -1 5
$100/person)... O -1 5

Saul B-ASP 1 5
is O -1 5
pretty O -1 5
good, O -1 5
but O -1 5
definitely O -1 5
not O -1 5
great. O -1 5

I O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
crab O -1 5
cocktail O -1 5
and O -1 5
it O -1 5
was O -1 5

all O -1 5
you O -1 5
could O -1 5

the O -1 5
lime. O -1 5

We O -1 5
ordered O -1 5
the O -1 5
chicken O -1 5
casserole, O -1 5
but O -1 5
what O -1 5
we O -1 5
got O -1 5
were O -1 5
a O -1 5
few O -1 5
small O -1 5
pieces O -1 5
of O -1 5
chicken, O -1 5
all O -1 5
dark O -1 5
meat B-ASP 0 5
and O -1 5
on O -1 5
the O -1 5

Next O -1 5
time, O -1 5
we O -1 5
wouldn't O -1 5
dare O -1 5
ordering O -1 5
anything O -1 5
else O -1 5
other O -1 5
than O -1 5
some O -1 5
simple O -1 5
Asian B-ASP 2 5
appetizers I-ASP 2 5
and O -1 5
drinks. O -1 5

After O -1 5
waiting B-ASP 0 5
for O -1 5
almost O -1 5
an O -1 5

the O -1 5

The O -1 5
happy O -1 5

is O -1 5
so O -1 5
cheap(1), O -1 5
but O -1 5
that O -1 5
does O -1 5
not O -1 5
reflect(2) O -1 5
the O -1 5
service O -1 5
or O -1 5
the I-ASP 2 5
atmosphere. O -1 5

You O -1 5
must O -1 5
try O -1 5
the O -1 5

The O -1 5

the O -1 5

is O -1 5
good O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
sushi B-ASP 2 5
was O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
great. O -1 5

It O -1 5
also O -1 5
has O -1 5
lots O -1 5
of O -1 5
other O -1 5
Korean B-ASP 2 5

that O -1 5
are O -1 5
affordable O -1 5
and O -1 5
just O -1 5

about O -1 5

so O -1 5
there's O -1 5
more O -1 5

with O -1 5
the O -1 5

than O -1 5
you'd O -1 5
expect O -1 5
(i.e., O -1 5

The O -1 5

I O -1 5
cannot O -1 5
imagine O -1 5
better O -1 5
Indian B-ASP 2 5
food I-ASP 2 5
in O -1 5
all O -1 5
of O -1 5

It O -1 5
was O -1 5
pleasantly O -1 5

The O -1 5
one O -1 5

was O -1 5
actually O -1 5

it O -1 5
was O -1 5

hey, O -1 5
it's O -1 5
more(2) O -1 5

please O -1 5
with O -1 5
every O -1 5
choice O -1 5
which O -1 5
included: O -1 5
ceviche B-ASP 2 5
mix I-ASP 2 5
(special), I-ASP 2 5
crab O -1 5
dumplings, O -1 5
assorted O -1 5
sashimi, O -1 5
sushi O -1 5
and O -1 5
rolls, O -1 5
two O -1 5
types O -1 5
of O -1 5
sake, O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
banana O -1 5
tempura. O -1 5

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
very O -1 5
surprised O -1 5
by O -1 5
how O -1 5
good O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 2 5
was O -1 5
on O -1 5
our O -1 5
first O -1 5
visit O -1 5
here O -1 5
on O -1 5
a O -1 5
Sunday O -1 5
night. O -1 5

Also, O -1 5
the O -1 5
sandwiches B-ASP 0 5
(nearing O -1 5
$7) O -1 5
didn't O -1 5
come O -1 5
with O -1 5
anything O -1 5
like O -1 5
chips O -1 5
or O -1 5
a O -1 5
side. O -1 5

then O -1 5
she O -1 5
made O -1 5
a O -1 5
fuss O -1 5
about O -1 5
not O -1 5
being O -1 5
able O -1 5
to O -1 5
add O -1 5
1 O -1 5
or O -1 5
2 O -1 5
chairs B-ASP 1 5
on O -1 5
either O -1 5
end O -1 5
of O -1 5
the O -1 5
table O -1 5
for O -1 5
additional O -1 5
people. O -1 5

For O -1 5
the O -1 5
price B-ASP 0 5
you O -1 5
pay O -1 5
for O -1 5
the O -1 5
food O -1 5
here, O -1 5
you'd O -1 5
expect O -1 5
it O -1 5
to O -1 5
be O -1 5
at O -1 5
least O -1 5
on O -1 5
par O -1 5
with O -1 5
other O -1 5
Japanese O -1 5
restaurants. O -1 5

Good(1), O -1 5
because O -1 5
hey, O -1 5
it's O -1 5
more(2) O -1 5
food, O -1 5
but O -1 5
bad(3) O -1 5
because O -1 5
dim O -1 5
sum O -1 5
is O -1 5
supposed O -1 5
to O -1 5
be O -1 5
smaller(4) O -1 5
portions O -1 5
so O -1 5
you O -1 5
can O -1 5
try O -1 5
out O -1 5
more O -1 5
dishes O -1 5
and O -1 5
smaller(5) O -1 5
so I-ASP 1 5
that O -1 5
each O -1 5
dish O -1 5
is O -1 5
cheap(6). O -1 5

Meat O -1 5
dishes O -1 5
now O -1 5
adorn O -1 5
the O -1 5
selections, O -1 5
although O -1 5
there's O -1 5
still O -1 5
a O -1 5
large O -1 5
number O -1 5
of O -1 5
vegetarian-friendly B-ASP 2 5
choices. I-ASP 2 5

I O -1 5
asked O -1 5
for O -1 5
an O -1 5
open O -1 5
faced O -1 5
cheese O -1 5
sandwich O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
manager B-ASP 0 5
basically O -1 5
told O -1 5
me O -1 5
to O -1 5
take O -1 5
my O -1 5
business O -1 5
elsewhere! O -1 5

The O -1 5
portions B-ASP 2 5
are O -1 5
large O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
servers O -1 5
always O -1 5
surprise O -1 5
us O -1 5
with O -1 5
a O -1 5
different O -1 5
starter. O -1 5

My O -1 5
friend's O -1 5
food B-ASP 0 5
was O -1 5
also O -1 5
the O -1 5
complete O -1 5
opposite O -1 5
of O -1 5
what O -1 5
it's O -1 5
supposed O -1 5
to O -1 5
taste O -1 5
like O -1 5
(aND O -1 5
look O -1 5
like). O -1 5

They O -1 5
did O -1 5
not O -1 5
have O -1 5
mayonnaise, B-ASP 0 5
forgot O -1 5
our O -1 5
toast, O -1 5
left O -1 5
out O -1 5
ingredients O -1 5
(ie O -1 5
cheese O -1 5
in O -1 5
an O -1 5
omelet), O -1 5
below O -1 5
hot O -1 5
temperatures O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
bacon O -1 5
was O -1 5
so O -1 5
over O -1 5
cooked O -1 5
it O -1 5
crumbled O -1 5
on O -1 5
the O -1 5
plate O -1 5
when O -1 5
you O -1 5
touched O -1 5
it. O -1 5

The O -1 5
selection B-ASP 2 5
of I-ASP 2 5
food I-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
excellent(1) O -1 5
(I'm O -1 5
not O -1 5
used O -1 5
to O -1 5
having O -1 5
much O -1 5
choice O -1 5
at O -1 5
restaurants), O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
atmosphere O -1 5
is O -1 5
great(2). O -1 5
