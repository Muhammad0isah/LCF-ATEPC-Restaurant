I O -1 3

encouraged O -1 3
enough O -1 3
to O -1 3
return O -1 3
at O -1 3
lunch B-ASP 1 3

the O -1 3

that O -1 3
went O -1 3
very O -1 3

However, O -1 3
go O -1 3
for O -1 3
the O -1 3

the O -1 1

The O -1 3
location B-ASP 1 3

is O -1 3
Ok O -1 3

the O -1 3

is O -1 3
what O -1 3
makes O -1 3
up O -1 3

Where O -1 3

we O -1 0
sat O -1 0
at O -1 0
the O -1 0

the O -1 0

didn't O -1 0
seem O -1 0

he O -1 0
wanted O -1 0
to O -1 0

The O -1 3

(WOW) O -1 3

I O -1 0

a O -1 0
few O -1 0
minutes O -1 0

during O -1 0

i O -1 0
recommend O -1 0
that O -1 0
you O -1 0
make O -1 0
a O -1 0
reservation. B-ASP 1 0

We O -1 3
were O -1 3
told O -1 3
that O -1 3
the O -1 3
wait B-ASP 1 3
was O -1 3
about O -1 3
twenty O -1 3
minutes O -1 3
and O -1 3
there O -1 3
would O -1 3
be O -1 3
no O -1 3

for O -1 3
our O -1 3

This O -1 3

Overall, O -1 3
the O -1 3

the O -1 3

I O -1 4

nothing O -1 0

always O -1 3
on O -1 3
the O -1 3
money. O -1 3

The O -1 0
service O -1 0
was O -1 0
a O -1 0
bit O -1 0
slow(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
portions O -1 0
are O -1 0
a O -1 0
bit O -1 0
small O -1 0

if O -1 0
you O -1 0
are O -1 0
hungry O -1 0

in O -1 0
a O -1 0

this O -1 0
is O -1 0
not O -1 0
the O -1 0

you(2). O -1 0

And O -1 0
their O -1 0
prices O -1 0
are O -1 0
very O -1 0
high(1) O -1 0
- O -1 0
they O -1 0
actually O -1 0
think O -1 0
that O -1 0
they O -1 0
can O -1 0
get O -1 0
away O -1 0
with O -1 0

such(2) O -1 0

cool O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3

hear O -1 3
well O -1 3
there. O -1 3

The O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
dreadfully O -1 0
slow O -1 0
(the O -1 0
place O -1 0
was O -1 0
only O -1 0
half O -1 0
full) O -1 0
and O -1 0
a O -1 0
smile O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
been O -1 0
nice... O -1 0

The O -1 3
prices B-ASP 2 3
cannot O -1 3
be O -1 3
beat O -1 3
for O -1 3
the O -1 3
quality, O -1 3
quantity, O -1 3
freshness O -1 3
and O -1 3
taste. O -1 3

Definitely O -1 0
not O -1 0
worth O -1 0
the O -1 0
price! B-ASP 0 0

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 3 3
was O -1 3
very O -1 3
good, O -1 3
but O -1 3
not O -1 3
very O -1 3
thai. O -1 3

The O -1 3
main O -1 3
draw O -1 3
of O -1 3
this O -1 3
place O -1 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
price. B-ASP 2 3

The O -1 3
corned O -1 3

and O -1 3
pastrami B-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
excellent, O -1 3
much O -1 3

and O -1 1
again. O -1 1

I O -1 3
really O -1 3
loved O -1 3
the O -1 3
different O -1 3

that's O -1 3
the O -1 3

(except O -1 0
in O -1 0
a O -1 0

The O -1 0

is O -1 0

The O -1 3
ambiance B-ASP 3 3
was O -1 3
pretty O -1 3
cool(1), O -1 3
but O -1 3
not O -1 3
worth O -1 3
the O -1 3

The O -1 0
main O -1 0
downside O -1 0
to O -1 0

the O -1 0

unheralded, O -1 0
the O -1 0
service B-ASP 2 0
impecible, O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0

magnificant. O -1 0

Their O -1 3
exotic O -1 3

is O -1 3
basic O -1 3
ly O -1 3
a O -1 3
delcious(1) O -1 3
little O -1 3

with O -1 3
a O -1 3

The O -1 3
food, O -1 3
drinks B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
service O -1 3
are O -1 3
clearly O -1 3
among O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
city. O -1 3

The O -1 0
Halibut O -1 0
was O -1 0
too O -1 0
salty, O -1 0
dessert O -1 0
was O -1 0
so O -1 0
so O -1 0
(don't O -1 0
waste O -1 0
any O -1 0
of O -1 0
your O -1 0
calories) O -1 0
and O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
poor. O -1 0

It's O -1 5

best O -1 5
Japanese O -1 5
restaurant O -1 5
in O -1 5
the O -1 5
East O -1 5

it's O -1 5

that O -1 0
their O -1 0
job O -1 0
isn't O -1 0

Our O -1 0

apparently O -1 0
never O -1 0
tried O -1 0
any O -1 0

Yes, O -1 3
they O -1 3
use O -1 3

even O -1 3

i O -1 0
get O -1 0
good O -1 0
good B-ASP 2 0
and O -1 0
bad O -1 0
service. O -1 0

Unfortunately, O -1 5
the O -1 5
food B-ASP 0 5
was O -1 5
NOT O -1 5
something O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
worked O -1 5
up O -1 5
about. O -1 5

And O -1 3
all O -1 3
the O -1 3
[female] I-ASP 2 3
servers I-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
cute O -1 3
too, O -1 3
which O -1 3
is O -1 3
always O -1 3
nice. O -1 3

We O -1 3
parked O -1 3
on O -1 3
the O -1 3
block O -1 3
of O -1 3
Nina's O -1 3
the O -1 3
place B-ASP 2 3
looked O -1 3
nice, O -1 3
with O -1 3
people O -1 3
obviously O -1 3
enjoying O -1 3
their O -1 3
pizzas. O -1 3

The O -1 3
staff B-ASP 2 3
greeted O -1 3
me O -1 3
warmly O -1 3
at O -1 3
the O -1 3
door O -1 3
and O -1 3
I O -1 3
was O -1 3
seated O -1 3
promptly O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
excellent(2). O -1 3

The O -1 3
service B-ASP 2 3
we O -1 3
experienced O -1 3
was O -1 3
friendly O -1 3
and O -1 3
good. O -1 3

Over O -1 3
the O -1 3
years O -1 3
the O -1 3
host, B-ASP 2 3
Vittorio, O -1 3
and O -1 3
his O -1 3
crew, O -1 3
have O -1 3
always O -1 3
treated O -1 3
me O -1 3
as O -1 3
family--although O -1 3
with O -1 3
all O -1 3
the O -1 3
business O -1 3
this O -1 3
not-so-little O -1 3
gem O -1 3
does, O -1 3
it O -1 3
amazing O -1 3
he's O -1 3
even O -1 3
able O -1 3
to O -1 3
remember O -1 3
a O -1 3
consistent O -1 3
but O -1 3
not-so-frequent O -1 3
visitor. O -1 3

(food O -1 0
was O -1 0
delivered O -1 0
by O -1 0
a O -1 0
busboy, B-ASP 0 0
not O -1 0
waiter) O -1 0
We O -1 0
got O -1 0
no O -1 0
cheese O -1 0
offered O -1 0
for O -1 0
the O -1 0
pasta, O -1 0
our O -1 0
water O -1 0
and O -1 0
wine O -1 0
glasses O -1 0
remained O -1 0
EMPTY O -1 0
our O -1 0
entire O -1 0
meal, O -1 0
when O -1 0
we O -1 0
would O -1 0
have O -1 0
easily O -1 0
spent O -1 0
another O -1 0
$20 O -1 0
on O -1 0

Prices B-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
very O -1 3
good. O -1 3

The O -1 3
wait B-ASP 2 3
staff I-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
very O -1 3
freindly, O -1 3
they O -1 3
make O -1 3
it O -1 3
feel O -1 3
like O -1 3
you're O -1 3
eating O -1 3
in O -1 3
a O -1 3
freindly O -1 3
little O -1 3
european O -1 3
town. O -1 3

Furthermore, O -1 0
the O -1 0
rice O -1 0
had O -1 0
no(1) O -1 0
seasoning, O -1 0
so O -1 0
the O -1 0
sushi O -1 0
was O -1 0
bland O -1 0
and O -1 0
disgusting(2). O -1 0

Considering O -1 0
their O -1 0
price O -1 0
of O -1 0
$6.25 O -1 0
for O -1 0
lunch O -1 0
special, O -1 0
the O -1 0
dish B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
ridiculously O -1 0
small. O -1 0

Try O -1 3
the O -1 3
Pad B-ASP 2 3
Thai, I-ASP 2 3
it's O -1 3
fabulous(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
their O -1 3
prices O -1 3
are O -1 3
so O -1 3
cheap!(2) O -1 3

The O -1 0
price B-ASP 2 0
is O -1 0
reasonable O -1 0
although O -1 0
the O -1 0
service O -1 0
is O -1 0
poor. O -1 0

Not O -1 3
only O -1 3
was O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
outstanding, O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
little O -1 3
'perks' B-ASP 2 3
were O -1 3
great. O -1 3

With O -1 0
so O -1 0

don't O -1 0

absurdly O -1 0

don't O -1 0
recognize O -1 0
they O -1 0
work O -1 0

glorified O -1 0

the O -1 3
food B-ASP 0 3
is O -1 3
horrible, O -1 3
the O -1 3

gabriella O -1 3

those O -1 2

not O -1 2
good(1) O -1 2
and O -1 2

Service B-ASP 2 3
here O -1 3
was O -1 3

fantastic(2). O -1 3

While O -1 3
the O -1 3

great, O -1 3
the O -1 3

could O -1 3
have O -1 3
been O -1 3
a O -1 3

better. O -1 3

The O -1 3

The O -1 3

of O -1 3
this O -1 3

is O -1 3
the O -1 3
price. B-ASP 2 3

fascinating, O -1 3
but O -1 3
left O -1 3
room O -1 3
for O -1 3
conversation(1), O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
bartender O -1 3
made O -1 3
superb(2) O -1 3
drinks. O -1 3

The O -1 0
owner O -1 0
and O -1 0
staff O -1 0
are O -1 0
all O -1 0
Japanese O -1 0
as O -1 0
well O -1 0
and O -1 0
that O -1 0
adds O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
entire O -1 0
ambiance. B-ASP 2 0

The O -1 0
Sashimi O -1 0
portion O -1 0
are O -1 0
big O -1 0
enough O -1 0
to O -1 0
appease O -1 0
most O -1 0
people(1), O -1 0
but O -1 0
I O -1 0
didn't O -1 0
like O -1 0
the O -1 0
fact(2) O -1 0
they O -1 0
used I-ASP 0 0
artifical I-ASP 0 0
lobster O -1 0
meat. O -1 0

There's O -1 0
candlelight O -1 0
and O -1 0
music. B-ASP 1 0

This O -1 3
place O -1 3
has O -1 3
many O -1 3
different O -1 3
styles B-ASP 2 3
of I-ASP 2 3
pizza I-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
they O -1 3
are O -1 3
all O -1 3
amazing. O -1 3

I O -1 3
also O -1 3
recommend O -1 3
the O -1 3
rice O -1 3
dishes O -1 3
or O -1 3
the O -1 3
different O -1 3
varieties O -1 3
of O -1 3

They've O -1 3

foods. I-ASP 2 3

Although O -1 3
the O -1 3
tables B-ASP 0 3
may O -1 3
be O -1 3
closely O -1 3
situated, O -1 3
the O -1 3
candle-light, O -1 3
food-quality O -1 3
and O -1 3
service O -1 3
overcompensate. O -1 3

The O -1 0
staff B-ASP 0 0
should O -1 0
be O -1 0
a O -1 0
bit O -1 0
more O -1 0
friendly. O -1 0

The O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
a O -1 0
bit O -1 0
slow(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
portions O -1 0
are O -1 0
a O -1 0
bit O -1 0
small O -1 0
so O -1 0
if O -1 0
you O -1 0
are O -1 0
hungry O -1 0
and O -1 0
in O -1 0
a O -1 0

My O -1 3
GF O -1 3

I O -1 3
still O -1 3
choose O -1 3
to O -1 3
eat O -1 3
there O -1 3
a O -1 3
lot O -1 3
because O -1 3
of O -1 3
diverse O -1 3
cocktails, B-ASP 2 3
the O -1 3
chill O -1 3
decor, O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
decent O -1 3

The O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
not O -1 0
fresh, O -1 0
the O -1 0

very O -1 0
oily. O -1 0

For O -1 0
those O -1 0
prices B-ASP 0 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0

not O -1 3
as O -1 3
smooth O -1 3

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
problem O -1 1
is O -1 1
that O -1 1
the O -1 1

is O -1 1
a O -1 1
complete O -1 1
incompetent. O -1 1

Not O -1 3
a O -1 3
typical O -1 3
pizza O -1 3
joint, O -1 3
but O -1 3
good O -1 3
for O -1 3
a O -1 3
low O -1 3

We O -1 3

and O -1 3
they O -1 3
were O -1 3
served O -1 3
timely O -1 3
and O -1 3
fresh. O -1 3

It O -1 3
took O -1 3
about O -1 3
2 O -1 3
1/2 O -1 3

to O -1 3
be O -1 3

night O -1 3
without O -1 3
a O -1 3

we O -1 3
had O -1 3
to O -1 3
wait O -1 3
at O -1 3
the O -1 3
bar O -1 3
for O -1 3
a O -1 3
little O -1 3
while, O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3

was O -1 3
so O -1 3
nice O -1 3
and O -1 3
made O -1 3
our O -1 3
wait O -1 3
a O -1 3
great O -1 3
experience. O -1 3

I O -1 3
like(1) O -1 3
the O -1 3
somosas, O -1 3

and O -1 3
the O -1 3

but O -1 3
the O -1 3
dhosas O -1 3
and O -1 3
dhal O -1 3
were O -1 3
kinda O -1 3
dissapointing(2). O -1 3

The O -1 3

greeted O -1 3
me O -1 3
warmly O -1 3
at O -1 3
the O -1 3

I O -1 3
was O -1 3
seated O -1 3

the O -1 3

The O -1 3

I O -1 1

for O -1 1
a O -1 1
work O -1 1
dinner B-ASP 1 1

my O -1 1

noticed O -1 1
a O -1 1
very O -1 1
large O -1 1
waterbug O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1

Reasonably(1) O -1 3
priced O -1 3
with O -1 3

The O -1 3

is O -1 3

and O -1 3
eye-pleasing O -1 3
with O -1 3
several O -1 3

the O -1 3

which O -1 3
are O -1 3
great O -1 3
for O -1 3
a O -1 3

However, O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
summer O -1 3
of O -1 3
2003, O -1 3
it O -1 3
seems O -1 3
the O -1 3
management B-ASP 1 3
has O -1 3
changed O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
great O -1 3

The O -1 0

are O -1 0
dry, O -1 0
tasteless O -1 0

way O -1 0
overpriced. O -1 0

The O -1 3
food, O -1 3

and O -1 3
service B-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
clearly O -1 3
among O -1 3

city. O -1 3

out O -1 0

Because O -1 3
we O -1 3
didn't O -1 3
have O -1 3
a O -1 3
reservation, B-ASP 0 3
we O -1 3
could O -1 3
only O -1 3
sit O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
back O -1 3
garden, O -1 3
but O -1 3
it O -1 3
was O -1 3
great, O -1 3
secluded O -1 3
and O -1 3
perfect O -1 3
in O -1 3
nice O -1 3
weather. O -1 3

They O -1 5
did O -1 5
not O -1 5
have O -1 5
mayonnaise, O -1 5
forgot O -1 5
our O -1 5
toast, O -1 5
left O -1 5
out O -1 5
ingredients O -1 5
(ie O -1 5
cheese O -1 5
in O -1 5
an O -1 5
omelet), O -1 5
below O -1 5
hot O -1 5
temperatures O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
bacon B-ASP 0 5
was O -1 5
so O -1 5
over O -1 5
cooked O -1 5
it O -1 5
crumbled O -1 5
on O -1 5
the O -1 5

when O -1 5
you O -1 5
touched O -1 5

nothing O -1 1

got O -1 1

was O -1 3
delicious(1) O -1 3

clearly O -1 3
fresh(2) O -1 3

it O -1 0

blazing(1) O -1 0

definitely O -1 0
not O -1 0
edible O -1 0

Only O -1 0
drawback O -1 0
- O -1 0
they O -1 0
won't O -1 0
toast O -1 0
your O -1 0

door, B-ASP 1 0
with O -1 0

anticipating O -1 0
your O -1 0

you O -1 0

sense O -1 0
that O -1 0
you O -1 0

However, O -1 1
I O -1 1
was O -1 1
there O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1

my O -1 1

noticed O -1 1
a O -1 1
very O -1 1
large O -1 1
waterbug O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
ceiling. O -1 1

Our O -1 3
agreed O -1 3
favorite O -1 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
orrechiete O -1 3
with O -1 3
sausage O -1 3
and O -1 3
chicken O -1 3
(usually O -1 3
the O -1 3

enough O -1 3
to O -1 3
split O -1 3
the O -1 3

you O -1 3

both O -1 3
meats). O -1 3

This O -1 0
wasn't O -1 0

that O -1 0
was O -1 0
what O -1 0
made O -1 0
the O -1 0
place O -1 0
so O -1 0
special(2). O -1 0

But O -1 3
when O -1 3
you O -1 3
are O -1 3

the O -1 3

great, O -1 3
they O -1 3

the O -1 3
price O -1 3

the O -1 3

The O -1 1

so O -1 1
we O -1 1
waited O -1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1

about O -1 1
20 O -1 1

we're O -1 4
not O -1 4

The O -1 1

- O -1 3
delivery O -1 3
time O -1 3
was O -1 3
a O -1 3

slow(3), O -1 3

for O -1 3
the O -1 3
way O -1 3
this O -1 3
pizza O -1 3
tastes, O -1 3
I'm O -1 3
willing O -1 3
to O -1 3
overlook O -1 3
it(4). O -1 3

The O -1 3
fish O -1 3
is O -1 3
fresh O -1 3
and O -1 3
each O -1 3
piece O -1 3
is O -1 3
sliced O -1 3

and O -1 3
seasoned(1) O -1 3

This O -1 0

is O -1 0
asian-air O -1 0

You O -1 0
will O -1 0
pay O -1 0
a O -1 0
lot O -1 0
for(1) O -1 0
the O -1 0
decore, O -1 0
but O -1 0
the O -1 0
food O -1 0
is O -1 0
no O -1 0
better O -1 0
or O -1 0
worse O -1 0
than O -1 0

But O -1 0
the O -1 0
main O -1 0
hit O -1 0
was O -1 0
the O -1 0
whole B-ASP 2 0
grilled I-ASP 2 0
fish. I-ASP 2 0

The O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
greatest O -1 1
, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I O -1 1
suppose O -1 1
that's O -1 1
how O -1 1
they O -1 1
keep O -1 1
the O -1 1
prices B-ASP 2 1
down O -1 1
. O -1 1

That O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
problem O -1 0
since O -1 0
we O -1 0
paid O -1 0
about O -1 0
20 O -1 0

had O -1 3
the O -1 3

unlike O -1 3
some O -1 3

I O -1 3
felt O -1 3
there O -1 3
was O -1 3
more O -1 3

As O -1 0
far O -1 0
as O -1 0
the O -1 0
service B-ASP 3 0
goes, O -1 0
the O -1 0
waitresses O -1 0
were O -1 0
not O -1 0
particularly O -1 0
friendly, O -1 0
but O -1 0
they O -1 0
got O -1 0
the O -1 0
job O -1 0
done. O -1 0

But O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
part O -1 3
about O -1 3
LS O -1 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
late O -1 3
night O -1 3
atmosphere, B-ASP 2 3
delightfully O -1 3
free O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3

The O -1 3

limited O -1 3
but O -1 3
almost O -1 3
all O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
dishes B-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
excellent. O -1 3

The O -1 3
bread B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
soft(1) O -1 3

is O -1 3
tandoori O -1 3
styled O -1 3

very O -1 3

How O -1 1
pretentious O -1 1

inappropriate O -1 1
for O -1 1

that O -1 1
it O -1 1

After O -1 0
the O -1 0

we O -1 0

Normally O -1 3
that O -1 3
would O -1 3
be O -1 3
improper, O -1 3
however O -1 3
they O -1 3
were O -1 3
all O -1 3
delicious O -1 3
and O -1 3
my O -1 3
host B-ASP 1 3
did O -1 3
not O -1 3
complain. O -1 3

First O -1 0
of O -1 0
all, O -1 0
this O -1 0
place B-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0
*not* O -1 0
romantic, O -1 0
as O -1 0
claimed O -1 0
by O -1 0
Citysearch's O -1 0
editorial O -1 0
review. O -1 0

The O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
not O -1 0
fresh, O -1 0
the O -1 0
sauces B-ASP 0 0
were O -1 0
bland O -1 0

very O -1 0
oily. O -1 0

Best O -1 3
Indian B-ASP 2 3

I O -1 3

ever O -1 3
eaten. O -1 3

The O -1 0

two O -1 0
times O -1 0
I O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
from O -1 0
here O -1 0
my O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
soo O -1 0
spicy O -1 0
that O -1 0
I O -1 0
could O -1 0
barely O -1 0
eat O -1 0
it(1), O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
spice O -1 0
took O -1 0
away O -1 0
from(2) O -1 0
the O -1 0
flavor O -1 0
of O -1 0
the O -1 0
dish. O -1 0

It's O -1 3
the O -1 3
perfect O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
for O -1 3
NY O -1 3
life O -1 3
style, O -1 3
it O -1 3
got O -1 3
cool O -1 3

awsome O -1 3

and O -1 3
hanging O -1 3
at O -1 3
the O -1 3
pink O -1 3
bar... O -1 3

Yes, O -1 3
they O -1 3
use O -1 3
fancy O -1 3
ingredients, B-ASP 2 3
but O -1 3
even O -1 3
fancy O -1 3
ingredients O -1 3
don't O -1 3
make O -1 3
for O -1 3
good O -1 3
pizza O -1 3
unless O -1 3
someone O -1 3
knows O -1 3
how O -1 3
to O -1 3
get O -1 3
the O -1 3
crust O -1 3
right. O -1 3

What O -1 3
is O -1 3
even O -1 3
better, O -1 3
is O -1 3
that O -1 3
the O -1 3
prices B-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
very O -1 3
affordable O -1 3
as O -1 3
well, O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
really O -1 3
good. O -1 3

other O -1 3

it O -1 3
was O -1 3
impossible O -1 3
to O -1 3

the O -1 3
food. B-ASP 2 3

Great O -1 3

The O -1 0
service B-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0
always O -1 0
bad O -1 0
though, O -1 0
don't O -1 0
expect O -1 0
much O -1 0
of O -1 0
anything(1) O -1 0
from O -1 0
your O -1 0

This O -1 3

a O -1 3
consistently O -1 3
great O -1 3
place O -1 3
to O -1 3
dine B-ASP 2 3

We O -1 3
made O -1 3
early O -1 3
dinner O -1 3
reservations O -1 3
and O -1 3
were O -1 3
thoroughly O -1 3
impressed, O -1 3
reminds O -1 3
me O -1 3

They O -1 1
forgot O -1 1
a O -1 1
sandwich, B-ASP 1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
plastic O -1 1

and O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
include O -1 1
pita O -1 1

the O -1 1

The O -1 3
place O -1 3
is O -1 3
so O -1 3
cool O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
service B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
prompt O -1 3
and O -1 3
curtious. O -1 3

As O -1 0
for O -1 0
the O -1 0
bar, B-ASP 0 0
this O -1 0
is O -1 0
another O -1 0
bad O -1 0

The O -1 0

the O -1 0

The O -1 3

both O -1 4
felt O -1 4
the O -1 4

very O -1 4
average. O -1 4

The O -1 3

when O -1 3

The O -1 3

was O -1 3
accomodating, O -1 3
the O -1 3

was O -1 3
absolutely O -1 3

If O -1 3

or O -1 3
the O -1 3
ambience. O -1 3

The O -1 3
service O -1 3
was O -1 3
attentive, O -1 3
yet O -1 3
unimposing(1), O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
far O -1 3
better O -1 3
than O -1 3
many O -1 3
notorious O -1 3

Midtown(2) O -1 3

the O -1 3

Great O -1 3
for O -1 3

great O -1 3
for O -1 3

The O -1 3

is O -1 3
nice, O -1 3
but O -1 3
more O -1 3
casual O -1 3
than O -1 3
fine O -1 3
dining. O -1 3

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 1 3
is O -1 3
o.k., O -1 3
but O -1 3
not O -1 3
any O -1 3
better O -1 3
than O -1 3
what O -1 3
you O -1 3

at O -1 3

The O -1 0

were O -1 0
not O -1 0
attentive O -1 0

that O -1 0
the O -1 0

We O -1 3
all O -1 3
had O -1 3
the O -1 3
tasting(1) O -1 3
menu O -1 3
and O -1 3
unlike O -1 3
some O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
other O -1 3
reviews, O -1 3
I O -1 3
felt O -1 3
there O -1 3
was O -1 3
more O -1 3
than O -1 3
enough(2) O -1 3
food. O -1 3

Sit O -1 5

of I-ASP 1 4
the I-ASP 1 4

that O -1 4
came O -1 4

were O -1 4
mediocre. O -1 4

When O -1 3

the O -1 3

said, O -1 3
Sorry. O -1 3

The O -1 0

are O -1 0
big O -1 0
enough O -1 0
to O -1 0
appease O -1 0
most O -1 0
people(1), O -1 0
but O -1 0
I O -1 0
didn't O -1 0
like O -1 0
the O -1 0

they O -1 0
used I-ASP 0 0

The O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
amazing, O -1 3
the O -1 3

was O -1 3
so O -1 3

and O -1 3
personable, O -1 3
and O -1 3
how O -1 3
about O -1 3
that O -1 3
ambience! O -1 3

Based O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1
reviews O -1 1
for O -1 1
dinner, B-ASP 2 1
this O -1 1
is O -1 1
a O -1 1
place O -1 1
I O -1 1
would O -1 1
reconsider O -1 1
revisiting O -1 1
for O -1 1
that, O -1 1
but O -1 1
definitely O -1 1
not O -1 1
for O -1 1
Dim O -1 1
Sum O -1 1
again. O -1 1

Quality O -1 3
of O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
excellent O -1 3
and O -1 3
price O -1 3
is O -1 3
cheap, O -1 3
stick O -1 3
to O -1 3
pork, O -1 3
fish, O -1 3
chicken, B-ASP 2 3
lamb O -1 3
and O -1 3
vegetables. O -1 3

The O -1 3
food, B-ASP 2 3
drinks O -1 3
and O -1 3
service O -1 3
are O -1 3
clearly O -1 3
among O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
city. O -1 3

First O -1 0
the O -1 0
wrong O -1 0

came O -1 0
out O -1 0
with O -1 0

tried O -1 0
to O -1 0
order O -1 0
a O -1 0
second O -1 0

for O -1 0

at O -1 0
the O -1 0

The O -1 3
duck B-ASP 2 3
confit I-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
always O -1 3

and O -1 3
the O -1 3

with O -1 3
figs O -1 3
was O -1 3
out O -1 3
of O -1 3
this O -1 3
world(2). O -1 3

Our O -1 3
waitress B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
sweet O -1 3
and O -1 3
accomodating, O -1 3
not O -1 3
overbearing. O -1 3

I O -1 0
wasn't O -1 0
thrilled O -1 0
to O -1 0
have O -1 0
to O -1 0
wait B-ASP 0 0
on O -1 0
line O -1 0
for O -1 0
thirty O -1 0
minutes, O -1 0
but O -1 0
I O -1 0
guess O -1 0
that's O -1 0
the O -1 0
price O -1 0
you O -1 0
pay O -1 0
for O -1 0
a O -1 0
popular O -1 0
place. O -1 0

The O -1 3
entertainment B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
great(1) O -1 3
they O -1 3
have O -1 3
shows O -1 3
that O -1 3

The O -1 1

The O -1 3

offered O -1 3
were O -1 3
unique, O -1 3
very O -1 3

and O -1 3
fresh O -1 3

Furthermore, O -1 0
the O -1 0

the O -1 5
best O -1 5
Japanese O -1 5
restaurant O -1 5
in O -1 5
the O -1 5
East O -1 5

it's O -1 5
a O -1 5

its O -1 5
modest O -1 5

but O -1 1
when O -1 1
we O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1

there O -1 1
weren't O -1 1
a O -1 1

them O -1 1
were O -1 1

The O -1 3

really O -1 3

This O -1 3

doesn't O -1 3
compare O -1 3

Mamoun's O -1 3

that's O -1 3
just O -1 3
my O -1 3
opinion. O -1 3

Okay O -1 3

However, O -1 3
go O -1 3

at O -1 2
the O -1 2
conclusion O -1 2
of O -1 2
this O -1 2
culinary O -1 2
nightmare O -1 2
the O -1 2
check O -1 2
was O -1 2
given O -1 2

over O -1 2
a O -1 2

Went O -1 1
there O -1 1
with O -1 1
my O -1 1
wife O -1 1
and O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
to O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
a O -1 1

even O -1 1
though O -1 1
you O -1 1
could O -1 1
see O -1 1

many O -1 1

The O -1 3

always O -1 3

made O -1 3
and O -1 3
wine O -1 3

is O -1 3
fairly O -1 3
priced. O -1 3

Overall, O -1 0
not O -1 0

one O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
values B-ASP 2 3
for I-ASP 2 3
your I-ASP 2 3
money. I-ASP 2 3

Because O -1 3
we O -1 3
didn't O -1 3
have O -1 3
a O -1 3
reservation, O -1 3
we O -1 3
could O -1 3
only O -1 3
sit O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
back B-ASP 2 3

in O -1 3

we O -1 0
sat O -1 0
at O -1 0
the O -1 0

the O -1 0

The O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
was O -1 1
mediocre O -1 1
at O -1 1
best O -1 1

it O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
horrible O -1 1

that O -1 1
made O -1 1
me O -1 1
vow O -1 1
never O -1 1

All O -1 1

expect O -1 1
to O -1 1
be O -1 1
delayed O -1 1
15-20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
as O -1 1
the O -1 1

I O -1 3
don't O -1 3
like O -1 3
Indian B-ASP 2 3

this O -1 3
was O -1 3
delicious, O -1 3
however O -1 3
you O -1 3
want O -1 3
to O -1 3
factor O -1 3
that O -1 3

even O -1 3
the O -1 3
wine B-ASP 2 3

the I-ASP 2 3

was O -1 3
good. O -1 3

In O -1 2

(to O -1 2

as(1) O -1 3

the O -1 3

overcompensate. O -1 3

just O -1 3

the O -1 3

the O -1 3

in O -1 3
unexpected O -1 3

I O -1 3
don't O -1 3
like O -1 3
Indian B-ASP 2 3
food I-ASP 2 3
too O -1 3
much O -1 3
and O -1 3
this O -1 3
was O -1 3
delicious, O -1 3
however O -1 3
you O -1 3
want O -1 3
to O -1 3
factor O -1 3
that O -1 3
into O -1 3
the O -1 3
equation. O -1 3

They O -1 3
do O -1 3
cater B-ASP 2 3
to O -1 3
American O -1 3
palates, O -1 3
but O -1 3
if O -1 3
you O -1 3
like O -1 3
it O -1 3
hot O -1 3
let O -1 3
them O -1 3
know O -1 3
and O -1 3
they O -1 3
are O -1 3
more O -1 3
than O -1 3
willing O -1 3
to O -1 3
oblige! O -1 3

Also, O -1 3
top O -1 3

Its O -1 3
worth O -1 3
the O -1 3

though. O -1 3

It's O -1 3
a O -1 3
nice O -1 3

getting O -1 0

but O -1 0
somehow O -1 0
managed O -1 0
to O -1 0
have O -1 0
a O -1 0
short O -1 0

we O -1 0
did O -1 0

that O -1 0
some O -1 0

rarely O -1 1
have O -1 1

were O -1 3
very O -1 3

in O -1 3

It O -1 0

The O -1 0

more O -1 1
than O -1 1
triples O -1 1

and O -1 1
that's O -1 1
not O -1 1

If O -1 3

definitely O -1 3
stop O -1 3

The O -1 3

what O -1 3

The O -1 0

outstanding, O -1 3
but O -1 3
everything O -1 3
else O -1 3
about O -1 3
this O -1 3

is O -1 3

I O -1 3

it's O -1 3
very O -1 3

Yes, O -1 3
they O -1 3
use O -1 3
fancy O -1 3
ingredients, B-ASP 2 3
but O -1 3
even O -1 3
fancy O -1 3

someone O -1 3
knows O -1 3
how O -1 3

right. O -1 3

I O -1 3
didn't O -1 3
complain, O -1 3
I O -1 3
liked O -1 3
the O -1 3
atmosphere B-ASP 2 3
so O -1 3
much. O -1 3

The O -1 2
bartender B-ASP 0 2
on O -1 2
my O -1 2
most O -1 2
recent O -1 2
visit O -1 2
was O -1 2
so O -1 2
incredibly O -1 2
rude(1) O -1 2
that O -1 2
I O -1 2
will O -1 2
never O -1 2
go O -1 2
back(2). O -1 2

The O -1 3
service B-ASP 3 3
was O -1 3
attentive, O -1 3
yet O -1 3
unimposing(1), O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
far O -1 3
better O -1 3
than O -1 3
many O -1 3
notorious O -1 3
restaurants O -1 3
in O -1 3
Midtown(2) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
wine O -1 3
list O -1 3
is O -1 3
extensive(3) O -1 3
and O -1 3
well(4) O -1 3
priced. O -1 3

We O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
the O -1 0
special, O -1 0
grilled B-ASP 0 0
branzino, I-ASP 0 0
that O -1 0
was O -1 0
so O -1 0
infused O -1 0
with O -1 0
bone, O -1 0
it O -1 0
was O -1 0
difficult O -1 0
to O -1 0
eat. O -1 0

A O -1 3
cool O -1 3
bar O -1 3
with O -1 3
great O -1 3
food, B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
tons O -1 3
of O -1 3
excellent O -1 3
beer. O -1 3

But, O -1 1
they O -1 1
were O -1 1
too O -1 1
big O -1 1
for O -1 1
the O -1 1
bun. B-ASP 1 1

The O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
not O -1 0
fresh, O -1 0
the O -1 0
sauces B-ASP 0 0
were O -1 0
bland O -1 0
and O -1 0
very O -1 0
oily. O -1 0

Again, O -1 3
the O -1 3
waitress B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
awesome. O -1 3

Highly O -1 3
recommend O -1 3
this O -1 3
as O -1 3
great O -1 3
value B-ASP 2 3
for O -1 3
excellent O -1 3
sushi O -1 3
and O -1 3
service. O -1 3

Delicate(1) O -1 3
spices, O -1 3

and O -1 3
a O -1 3
kick-ass(2) O -1 3

This O -1 3

is O -1 3
the O -1 3
most O -1 3
Japanese O -1 3
it O -1 3
can O -1 3
ever O -1 3
get. O -1 3

sit O -1 2

take O -1 2
out O -1 2
prices B-ASP 1 2

They O -1 3

in O -1 3

fresh O -1 3

Decor O -1 3
is O -1 3
nice O -1 3

The O -1 1

The O -1 0

One O -1 3
thing O -1 3
I O -1 3
liked O -1 3
about O -1 3
this O -1 3
place O -1 3
is O -1 3
that O -1 3
I O -1 3
never O -1 3
felt O -1 3

to O -1 3
give O -1 3

The O -1 3

also O -1 3
great(1), O -1 3
and O -1 3
my O -1 3
friend O -1 3
who O -1 3
grew O -1 3
up O -1 3
in O -1 3
Manhattan O -1 3
claims O -1 3
that O -1 3
no O -1 3

promptly.The O -1 3

Only O -1 3

but O -1 3
the O -1 3
house O -1 3
varities O -1 3
are O -1 3
actually O -1 3
quite O -1 3
good. O -1 3

The O -1 3

makes O -1 3
this O -1 3

one O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
better O -1 3

in O -1 3
NY. O -1 3

Most O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
sandwiches B-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
made O -1 3
with O -1 3
soy O -1 3
mayonaise O -1 3
which O -1 3
is O -1 3
actually O -1 3
pretty O -1 3
good. O -1 3

The O -1 3
guac B-ASP 3 3
is O -1 3
fresh(1), O -1 3
yet O -1 3
lacking(2) O -1 3
flavor, O -1 3
we O -1 3
like O -1 3
to O -1 3
add O -1 3
our(3) O -1 3
fresh O -1 3
salsa O -1 3
into O -1 3

The O -1 3

the O -1 3
premium O -1 3

This O -1 3
is O -1 3
some O -1 3
really O -1 3
good, O -1 3
inexpensive O -1 3
sushi. B-ASP 2 3

My O -1 1
suggestion O -1 1
is O -1 1
to O -1 1
eat B-ASP 2 1
family I-ASP 2 1
style I-ASP 2 1
because O -1 1
you'll O -1 1
want O -1 1
to O -1 1
try O -1 1
the O -1 1
other O -1 1
dishes. O -1 1

Any O -1 1
if O -1 1
you O -1 1
have O -1 1
a O -1 1
reservation O -1 1
you'll O -1 1
wait O -1 1
for O -1 1
max O -1 1
5 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
- O -1 1
so O -1 1
have O -1 1
a O -1 1
drink B-ASP 1 1
at O -1 1
the O -1 1
bar. O -1 1

However, O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
summer O -1 3
of O -1 3
2003, O -1 3
it O -1 3
seems O -1 3
the O -1 3
management O -1 3
has O -1 3
changed O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
great O -1 3
big O -1 3
door B-ASP 2 3
has O -1 3
been O -1 3
replaced O -1 3
for O -1 3
a O -1 3
glass O -1 3
front O -1 3
ridding O -1 3
itself O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
dark O -1 3
romantic O -1 3

If O -1 3
you O -1 3
are O -1 3
someone O -1 3
who O -1 3

The O -1 3

accomodating, O -1 3
the O -1 3
ambiance O -1 3
is O -1 3
exciting O -1 3
and O -1 3
yet O -1 3
relaxed, O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
out O -1 3
of O -1 3
this O -1 3
world! O -1 3

Great O -1 3
for O -1 3
groups, O -1 3
great O -1 3
for O -1 3
a O -1 3

great O -1 3
for O -1 3

that O -1 5

not O -1 5

pick O -1 3
the O -1 3
fried O -1 3
chicken, O -1 3
pork B-ASP 1 3
chop, I-ASP 1 3
and O -1 3
noodle O -1 3
dishes O -1 3
that O -1 3
we O -1 3
all O -1 3
ordered. O -1 3

Aside O -1 3
from O -1 3
the O -1 3
Sea O -1 3
Urchin, O -1 3
the O -1 3
chef O -1 3
recommended O -1 3
an O -1 3
assortment O -1 3
of O -1 3
fish O -1 3
including O -1 3
Fatty O -1 3
Yellow O -1 3
Tail, O -1 3
Boton B-ASP 1 3
Shrimp, I-ASP 1 3
Blue O -1 3
Fin O -1 3
Torro O -1 3
(Fatty O -1 3
Tuna), O -1 3
Sea O -1 3
Eel, O -1 3
etc. O -1 3

Pizzas B-ASP 2 3
were O -1 3
excellent O -1 3
in O -1 3
addition O -1 3
to O -1 3
appetizers O -1 3
and O -1 3
main O -1 3
courses. O -1 3

My O -1 3
husband O -1 3
and O -1 3
I O -1 3
have O -1 3
been O -1 3
there O -1 3
at O -1 3
least O -1 3
6 O -1 3
times O -1 3
and O -1 3
we've O -1 3
always O -1 3
been O -1 3
given O -1 3
the O -1 3
highest(1) O -1 3
service O -1 3
and O -1 3
often O -1 3
free(2) O -1 3
desserts. O -1 3

The O -1 3
fillings O -1 3
may O -1 3
be O -1 3
unconventional(1) O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
dosa I-ASP 2 3
batter O -1 3
is O -1 3
definitely O -1 3
authentic O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
combinations O -1 3
very O -1 3
tasty(2). O -1 3

Service O -1 3
was O -1 3
decent, O -1 3
but O -1 3
not O -1 3
as O -1 3
smooth O -1 3
as O -1 3
I O -1 3
would O -1 3
expect O -1 3
from O -1 3
a O -1 3
place O -1 3
with O -1 3
these O -1 3
prices B-ASP 0 3
and O -1 3
reputation. O -1 3

Besides O -1 1
having O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
been O -1 1
promised O -1 1
given O -1 1
to O -1 1
other O -1 1
restaurant O -1 1
patrons O -1 1
twice O -1 1
before O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
actually O -1 1
seated, O -1 1
we O -1 1
were O -1 1
served B-ASP 0 1
dishes O -1 1
we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
ordered O -1 1
three O -1 1
times, O -1 1
received O -1 1
one O -1 1
of O -1 1
our O -1 1
orders O -1 1
20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
after O -1 1
the O -1 1
rest O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
had O -1 1
been O -1 1
served O -1 1
(and O -1 1
that O -1 1
order O -1 1
was O -1 1
undercooked), O -1 1
and O -1 1
charged O -1 1
$45 O -1 1
more O -1 1
than O -1 1
we O -1 1
should O -1 1
have O -1 1
been O -1 1
on O -1 1
our O -1 1
bill. O -1 1

I O -1 0
didn't O -1 0
go O -1 0
there O -1 0
for O -1 0
food B-ASP 1 0
so O -1 0
I O -1 0
can't O -1 0
comment. O -1 0

Chinatown O -1 3
definitely O -1 3
has O -1 3
better(1) O -1 3
quality O -1 3
with O -1 3
cheaper(2) O -1 3
prices. O -1 3

Service B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
extraordinary(1), O -1 3
yet O -1 3
not O -1 3
overbearing, O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
decor O -1 3
brings O -1 3
a O -1 3
taste O -1 3
of O -1 3
trendy O -1 3
SoHo O -1 3
into O -1 3
Queens(2). O -1 3

The O -1 5
steak O -1 5
is O -1 5
good, O -1 5
the O -1 5
fish B-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
good O -1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
sushi O -1 5
was O -1 5
surprisingly O -1 5
great. O -1 5

If O -1 1
I O -1 1
could O -1 1
rate O -1 1
the O -1 1
people B-ASP 2 1
this O -1 1
place O -1 1
would O -1 1
be O -1 1
off O -1 1
the O -1 1
charts O -1 1
- O -1 1
unfortunately O -1 1
- O -1 1
the O -1 1
pizza, O -1 1
sorry O -1 1
- O -1 1
not O -1 1
the O -1 1
best O -1 1
in O -1 1
NYC. O -1 1

I'm O -1 3
no O -1 3
food B-ASP 1 3
critic, O -1 3
but O -1 3
I'd O -1 3
like O -1 3
to O -1 3
think O -1 3
I O -1 3
have O -1 3
a O -1 3
tiny O -1 3
bit O -1 3
of O -1 3
experience O -1 3
under O -1 3
my O -1 3
belt O -1 3
having O -1 3
lived O -1 3
in O -1 3
NY O -1 3
for O -1 3
the O -1 3
last O -1 3
11 O -1 3
years. O -1 3

Everything, O -1 1
from O -1 1
the O -1 1
soft O -1 1

soggy O -1 1

and O -1 1

with O -1 1
an O -1 1
incredibly O -1 1
rude O -1 1
service O -1 1
to O -1 1
deliver O -1 1
below O -1 1
average O -1 1
food. O -1 1

The O -1 5
selection B-ASP 2 5
of I-ASP 2 5
food I-ASP 2 5
is O -1 5
excellent(1) O -1 5
(I'm O -1 5
not O -1 5
used O -1 5
to O -1 5
having O -1 5
much O -1 5
choice O -1 5
at O -1 5

the O -1 5

The O -1 0
fajita B-ASP 0 0
we O -1 0

the O -1 0
mole O -1 0

was O -1 0
way O -1 0
too O -1 0
sweet(2). O -1 0

After O -1 5
waiting B-ASP 0 5
for O -1 5
almost O -1 5
an O -1 5
hour(1), O -1 5
the O -1 5
waiter O -1 5
brusquely O -1 5
told O -1 5
us O -1 5
he'd O -1 5
forgotten(2) O -1 5
to O -1 5
give O -1 5
the O -1 5

our O -1 5
order. O -1 5

The O -1 5

full(2) O -1 0
of I-ASP 2 0

The O -1 3

100% O -1 3

I O -1 3

the O -1 3

the O -1 3
prices O -1 3
were O -1 3
great(2), O -1 3
on O -1 3

that O -1 3
the O -1 3

The O -1 3
anti-pasta B-ASP 2 3

the O -1 3
calamari, O -1 3
as O -1 3
were O -1 3
the O -1 3
filling O -1 3

unheralded, O -1 0
the O -1 0

impecible, O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0

Nosh O -1 3
as O -1 3
much O -1 3
as O -1 3
I O -1 3

challah I-ASP 2 3
sandwich O -1 3
I O -1 3
had O -1 3

otherworldly(2), O -1 3
the O -1 3

like O -1 3
Mom's, O -1 3

Yonah O -1 3

The O -1 3

except O -1 3
for O -1 3
offering O -1 3
the O -1 3
Chilean O -1 3
Sea O -1 3
Bass, O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
server O -1 3
does O -1 3
not O -1 3
offer O -1 3
up O -1 3
the O -1 3
specials B-ASP 1 3
that O -1 3
were O -1 3
written O -1 3

the O -1 3

outside. O -1 3

The O -1 0
mussaman B-ASP 0 0
curry I-ASP 0 0
that O -1 0
I O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
was O -1 0
as O -1 0
thin O -1 0
as O -1 0
water(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
aside O -1 0
from O -1 0
the O -1 0
poorly(2) O -1 0
fried O -1 0
tofu O -1 0
that O -1 0
I O -1 0
ordered O -1 0

me O -1 0
with O -1 0
ONE O -1 0
piece O -1 0
of O -1 0
poorly O -1 0
cooked(3) O -1 0

Service B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
usually O -1 3
pretty O -1 3
good. O -1 3

The O -1 3
first O -1 3
2 O -1 3
courses O -1 3
were O -1 3
very O -1 3
good(1), O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
chocolate O -1 3
sampler O -1 3
was O -1 3
too O -1 3
rich O -1 3
for O -1 3
me(2) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the I-ASP 0 3
dessert O -1 3
wine O -1 3
far O -1 3
too O -1 3
sweet(3). O -1 3

We O -1 3
had O -1 3
a O -1 3
party O -1 3
in O -1 3
their O -1 3
private B-ASP 1 3
room I-ASP 1 3
and O -1 3
they O -1 3
made O -1 3
it O -1 3
truly O -1 3
memorable O -1 3
and O -1 3
were O -1 3
very O -1 3
helpful O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
planning. O -1 3

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
above O -1 3
average O -1 3
for O -1 3
midtown O -1 3
and O -1 3
sligtly O -1 3
better O -1 3
than O -1 3
some O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
other O -1 3
Heartland O -1 3
Breweries O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3

Sandwiches, O -1 3

and O -1 3
salads, B-ASP 2 3
like O -1 3
the O -1 3
lemon-dressed O -1 3
cobb, O -1 3
are O -1 3
classic O -1 3
successes. O -1 3

I O -1 3
would O -1 3
recommend O -1 3
putting O -1 3
your O -1 3
name O -1 3
down(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
then O -1 3
getting O -1 3
a O -1 3
drink O -1 3
at O -1 3
a O -1 3
local O -1 3
bar O -1 3
first O -1 3
though(2) O -1 3
because O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
wait O -1 3
time. O -1 3

To O -1 0
begin, O -1 0

Our O -1 3
waitress B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
sweet O -1 3
and O -1 3
accomodating, O -1 3
not O -1 3
overbearing. O -1 3

There's O -1 0
candlelight B-ASP 1 0
and O -1 0
music. O -1 0

The O -1 3
menu O -1 3
is O -1 3
great(1), O -1 3
with O -1 3
a O -1 3
good(2) O -1 3
selection, O -1 3

everything O -1 3

absolutely O -1 3
delicious(3). O -1 3

Waitstaff B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
great, O -1 3
very O -1 3
attentive. O -1 3

So O -1 5
I've O -1 5
never O -1 5
actually O -1 5
been O -1 5
to O -1 5
M O -1 5
proper, O -1 5
but O -1 5
I've O -1 5
had O -1 5
it O -1 5
delivered B-ASP 1 5
a O -1 5
few O -1 5
times. O -1 5

The O -1 0
fajita B-ASP 0 0
we O -1 0
tried O -1 0
was O -1 0
tasteless O -1 0
and O -1 0
burned(1) O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
mole O -1 0
sauce O -1 0
was O -1 0
way O -1 0
too O -1 0
sweet(2). O -1 0

If O -1 0
you O -1 0
like O -1 0
spicy B-ASP 1 0
food I-ASP 1 0
get O -1 0
the O -1 0
chicken O -1 0
vindaloo. O -1 0

A O -1 3

Leaping O -1 3

and O -1 3
the O -1 3

had O -1 3
everything O -1 3
happy. O -1 3

It O -1 0
costs O -1 0
$2 O -1 0
extra O -1 0
to O -1 0
turn O -1 0
a O -1 0
regular O -1 0
roll O -1 0
into O -1 0
an O -1 0
inside-out O -1 0
roll, O -1 0
but O -1 0
the O -1 0
roll O -1 0
more O -1 0
than O -1 0
triples O -1 0
in O -1 0
size, O -1 0
and O -1 0
that's O -1 0
not O -1 0
just O -1 0
from O -1 0
the O -1 0
rice. B-ASP 1 0

Try O -1 2
ordering O -1 2
from O -1 2
the O -1 2
regular O -1 2
menu, B-ASP 2 2
then O -1 2
you O -1 2
would O -1 2

regret! O -1 2

Service O -1 3
was O -1 3
warm O -1 3
and O -1 3
attentive, O -1 3
beef O -1 3
carpaachio O -1 3
was O -1 3
exellent O -1 3
(huge O -1 3
portion) B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
pasta O -1 3
was O -1 3
fresh O -1 3
and O -1 3
well-prepared. O -1 3

Not O -1 3
only O -1 3
was O -1 3
the O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
outstanding, O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
little O -1 3
'perks' O -1 3
were O -1 3
great. O -1 3

Waitstaff B-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
very O -1 3
friendly. O -1 3

I O -1 3
love(1) O -1 3
the O -1 3
drinks, O -1 3
esp O -1 3
lychee O -1 3
martini, O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
also O -1 3
VERY O -1 3
good(2). O -1 3

I O -1 3
was O -1 3
pleasently O -1 3
surprised O -1 3
at O -1 3
the O -1 3
taste. B-ASP 2 3

I O -1 3
am O -1 3
amazed O -1 3
by O -1 3
the O -1 3
poor O -1 3
reviews- O -1 3
I O -1 3
find O -1 3
this O -1 3
place O -1 3
to O -1 3
be O -1 3
standout O -1 3
Italian O -1 3
in O -1 3
an O -1 3
area O -1 3
flooded O -1 3
with O -1 3
Italian- O -1 3
great O -1 3
prices, B-ASP 2 3
great O -1 3
atmosphere, O -1 3
good O -1 3
service O -1 3
and O -1 3
a O -1 3
wonderful O -1 3
wine O -1 3
list. O -1 3

Other O -1 3
than O -1 3
being O -1 3
a O -1 3
little O -1 3
crowded O -1 3
and O -1 3
a O -1 3
bit O -1 3
overpriced, O -1 3
the O -1 3
atmosphere B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
filled O -1 3
with O -1 3
energy O -1 3
(and O -1 3
the O -1 3
beautiful O -1 3
people O -1 3
of O -1 3
course) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
surprising O -1 3
good! O -1 3

The O -1 3
sushi O -1 3
is O -1 3
always O -1 3
fresh O -1 3
and O -1 3
yummy(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
menu O -1 3
is O -1 3
pretty O -1 3
varied(2). O -1 3

not O -1 3
only O -1 3
does O -1 3
make O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
pizza B-ASP 2 3
in O -1 3
NY O -1 3
, O -1 3
maybe O -1 3
anywhere. O -1 3

I O -1 3
think O -1 3
the O -1 3
stuff B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
better O -1 3
than O -1 3
Disney. O -1 3

For O -1 0
those O -1 0
prices O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
dressed O -1 0
up O -1 0
atmosphere B-ASP 0 0
you O -1 0
expect O -1 0
more O -1 0
and O -1 0
should O -1 0
get O -1 0
more. O -1 0

I O -1 3
recommend O -1 3
the(1) O -1 3
black I-ASP 2 3
roasted I-ASP 2 3
codfish, O -1 3
it O -1 3
was O -1 3
the O -1 3
best(2) O -1 3
dish O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
evening. O -1 3

Volare O -1 0

everyone O -1 0
gets O -1 0

same O -1 0
and O -1 0
you O -1 0
can't O -1 0
ask O -1 0
for O -1 0
more O -1 0
than O -1 0
that O -1 0

thats O -1 1
not O -1 1
really O -1 1
a O -1 1

The O -1 3

and O -1 3
a O -1 3
lowkey O -1 3
hip O -1 3
neighborhood(4) O -1 3
clientele. O -1 3

During O -1 3
our O -1 3
meal, B-ASP 1 3
the O -1 3
management O -1 3
came O -1 3
over O -1 3
and O -1 3
checked O -1 3
on O -1 3

and O -1 3
even O -1 3
bought O -1 3
us O -1 3
a O -1 3

I O -1 3
highly O -1 3
recommend O -1 3
it O -1 3
for O -1 3
not O -1 3
just O -1 3
its O -1 3
superb(1) O -1 3

but O -1 3
also O -1 3
for O -1 3
its O -1 3
friendly(2) O -1 3
owners O -1 3
and O -1 3
staff. O -1 3

Although O -1 3
they O -1 3
do O -1 3
the O -1 3
typical O -1 3
what O -1 3
kind O -1 3
of O -1 3
water B-ASP 1 3
would O -1 3
you O -1 3
like O -1 3
questions O -1 3
the O -1 3
service O -1 3
was O -1 3
good O -1 3
and O -1 3
overall O -1 3
very O -1 3
relaxing O -1 3
to O -1 3

The O -1 3

the O -1 3

is O -1 3
attentive(2), O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3

great(3). O -1 3

But O -1 3
the O -1 3
coconut B-ASP 2 3

good. O -1 3

I O -1 0

the O -1 0

We O -1 1
were O -1 1
on O -1 1
our O -1 1

and O -1 1
since O -1 1
I O -1 1
am O -1 1
in O -1 1
NY, O -1 1
we O -1 1
figured O -1 1
why O -1 1
not O -1 1
grab O -1 1
some O -1 1

I've O -1 0

my O -1 0

The O -1 0
main O -1 0
downside O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
place O -1 0
is O -1 0
the O -1 0
nazi-like O -1 0

it O -1 0
who O -1 0
constantly O -1 0

2 O -1 0

the O -1 0

was O -1 0
~$55.00, O -1 0
not O -1 0

Sure, O -1 3
the O -1 3
setting B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
nice. O -1 3

We've O -1 3
never O -1 3
had O -1 3
any O -1 3
problems O -1 3
with O -1 3
the O -1 3

but O -1 3
maybe O -1 3
we've O -1 3
been O -1 3
lucky? O -1 3

Excellent O -1 3

Based O -1 1
on O -1 1
the O -1 1

for O -1 1

this O -1 1
is O -1 1

I O -1 1
would O -1 1
reconsider O -1 1

definitely O -1 1
not O -1 1

This O -1 3
is O -1 3
some O -1 3
really O -1 3
good, O -1 3
inexpensive O -1 3

we O -1 3
left O -1 3

which O -1 3
was O -1 3

I O -1 3
feel. O -1 3

The O -1 0

definitely O -1 0
authentic O -1 0

the O -1 0

I've O -1 3

They O -1 3
are O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3

had. O -1 3

While O -1 1
the O -1 1

The O -1 3

each O -1 3

The O -1 0

a O -1 0

to O -1 3
the O -1 3

If O -1 0
you O -1 0
like O -1 0
spicy O -1 0

get O -1 0
the O -1 0
chicken B-ASP 1 0
vindaloo. I-ASP 1 0

The O -1 3
ambience O -1 3
was O -1 3
so O -1 3
fun(1), O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
prices O -1 3
were O -1 3
great(2), O -1 3
on O -1 3
top O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
fact O -1 3
that O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
really O -1 3
tasty(3). O -1 3

The O -1 3
environment O -1 3
is O -1 3
romantic, O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
horrible, O -1 3
the O -1 3
service B-ASP 0 3
is O -1 3
pathetic, O -1 3
and O -1 3
gabriella O -1 3
lies O -1 3
about O -1 3
everything O -1 3
she O -1 3
could. O -1 3

My O -1 3
friends O -1 3
and O -1 3
I O -1 3
experienced O -1 3
amazing O -1 3

delicious, O -1 3
new O -1 3
summer O -1 3
menu O -1 3
at O -1 3
Artisanal O -1 3
last O -1 3
night. O -1 3

Especially O -1 3
liked O -1 3
chicken O -1 3
tikka O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
naan, O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3

I'd O -1 3
highly O -1 3
recommend O -1 3
it O -1 3
for O -1 3
a O -1 3
special O -1 3
occasion O -1 3

it O -1 3
provides O -1 3
and O -1 3
intimate(1) O -1 3
setting O -1 3
and O -1 3
nice(2) O -1 3

We've O -1 0
only O -1 0
eaten O -1 0

lamb B-ASP 2 3
which O -1 3
was O -1 3
perfectly O -1 3
cooked O -1 3
and O -1 3
tasted O -1 3
awesome. O -1 3

The O -1 3
secret O -1 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
lunch O -1 3
menu O -1 3
which O -1 3
offers O -1 3
a O -1 3
complimentary O -1 3
appetizer B-ASP 2 3
with O -1 3
every O -1 3
entree O -1 3

The O -1 2
food O -1 2
itself O -1 2
was O -1 2
just O -1 2
ok O -1 2
- O -1 2
nothing O -1 2
spectacular(1) O -1 2
- O -1 2
but O -1 2
the O -1 2

many O -1 3
times, O -1 3
and O -1 3

The O -1 3

and O -1 3
the O -1 3

has O -1 3
a O -1 3

The O -1 3

at O -1 3
the O -1 3

for O -1 3
a O -1 3

and O -1 3
made O -1 3
our O -1 3

Highly O -1 3

I O -1 3
haven't O -1 3

there O -1 3
to O -1 3
pick O -1 3
up O -1 3

and O -1 3
it O -1 3
seems O -1 3
a O -1 3
very O -1 3
relaxing(2) O -1 3
place; O -1 3
also, O -1 3
the O -1 3
bar O -1 3
looks O -1 3

Salads B-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
a O -1 3
delicious O -1 3
way O -1 3
to O -1 3
begin O -1 3
the O -1 3

The O -1 3

very O -1 3
attentive(1), O -1 3
the O -1 3
ambience O -1 3
lovely(2), O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
superb(3). O -1 3

Anyway, O -1 2
the O -1 2
owner B-ASP 0 2
was O -1 2
fake. O -1 2

The O -1 3
anti-pasta B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
excellent, O -1 3
especially O -1 3
the O -1 3
calamari, O -1 3
as O -1 3
were O -1 3
the O -1 3
filling O -1 3
pasta O -1 3
mains. O -1 3

The O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
wonderful, O -1 3
tasty O -1 3
and O -1 3
filling, O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
service B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
professional O -1 3
and O -1 3
friendly. O -1 3

They O -1 5
did O -1 5
not O -1 5
have O -1 5
mayonnaise, O -1 5
forgot O -1 5
our O -1 5

below O -1 5
hot O -1 5

and O -1 5
the O -1 5

so O -1 5
over O -1 5
cooked O -1 5
it O -1 5
crumbled O -1 5

the O -1 5

when O -1 5

the I-ASP 2 3

All O -1 3
the O -1 3

were O -1 3
fabulous, O -1 3
the O -1 3

the O -1 3

kinda O -1 3
dissapointing(2). O -1 3

I O -1 3
really O -1 3

delicious(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
clearly O -1 3
fresh(2) O -1 3
ingredients O -1 3
were O -1 3

We O -1 3
arrived O -1 3
for O -1 3

that O -1 3
has O -1 3
an O -1 3

but, O -1 3
that's O -1 3
just O -1 3
it O -1 3
-- O -1 3
the O -1 3
PAST! O -1 3

The O -1 3
unattractive(1) O -1 3

me O -1 3
want O -1 3
to O -1 3
gag, O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
overpriced(2), O -1 3
there O -1 3
was O -1 3
the O -1 3
most O -1 3
awful(3) O -1 3
disco O -1 3

my O -1 3

you O -1 3

the O -1 3
price. O -1 3

The O -1 1
food O -1 1
was O -1 1
not O -1 1
very O -1 1
tasty, O -1 1
the O -1 1
portioins B-ASP 0 1
were O -1 1
tiny O -1 1
even O -1 1
for O -1 1
such O -1 1
a O -1 1
high O -1 1
quality O -1 1
restaurant. O -1 1

Bagels B-ASP 1 0

entire O -1 3
place B-ASP 0 3

the O -1 3
treatment O -1 3
we O -1 3
received O -1 3
felt O -1 3
as O -1 3
a O -1 3
conveyor O -1 3
belt. O -1 3

Even O -1 3
though O -1 3
the O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
was O -1 3
packed(1), O -1 3
we O -1 3
were O -1 3
seated O -1 3
promptly O -1 3
and O -1 3
even O -1 3
asked O -1 3
for O -1 3
a I-ASP 2 3
table O -1 3
upstairs O -1 3
with O -1 3
no O -1 3

Great O -1 3
burgers, O -1 3

and O -1 3
french B-ASP 2 3

Best O -1 3
of O -1 3
all O -1 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
warm O -1 3
vibe, O -1 3
the O -1 3
owner B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
super O -1 3
friendly O -1 3
and O -1 3
service O -1 3
is O -1 3
fast. O -1 3

We O -1 1
actually O -1 1
gave O -1 1
10% O -1 1

we O -1 1
have O -1 1
never O -1 1
done O -1 1
despite O -1 1
mediocre O -1 1
food B-ASP 1 1
and O -1 1

with O -1 1
my O -1 1

we O -1 1

to O -1 1

for O -1 1
a O -1 1

even O -1 1
though O -1 1
you O -1 1
could O -1 1
see O -1 1
there O -1 1
many O -1 1
that O -1 1
were O -1 1
empty O -1 1
with O -1 1
not O -1 1
reservation B-ASP 1 1

on O -1 1
them. O -1 1

They O -1 3
sell O -1 3
special O -1 3

everything O -1 3
have O -1 3
a O -1 3
topping, O -1 3

etc. O -1 3

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 1 3
is O -1 3
decent O -1 3
at O -1 3
best, O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
ambience, O -1 3
well, O -1 3
it's O -1 3
a O -1 3
matter O -1 3
of O -1 3
opinion, O -1 3
some O -1 3
may O -1 3
consider O -1 3
it O -1 3
to O -1 3
be O -1 3
a O -1 3
sweet O -1 3
thing, O -1 3
I O -1 3
thought O -1 3
it O -1 3
was O -1 3
just O -1 3
annoying. O -1 3

the O -1 3

Despite O -1 3
the O -1 3
fact O -1 3
that O -1 3
the O -1 3
space B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
large(1), O -1 3
they've O -1 3
overcrowded O -1 3
the O -1 3
floor(2) O -1 3
with O -1 3
tables. O -1 3

Food B-ASP 1 3
is O -1 3
average, O -1 3
and O -1 3
I O -1 3
would O -1 3
say O -1 3
even O -1 3
the O -1 3
chain O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
Baluchi's O -1 3
tastes O -1 3
better. O -1 3

A O -1 3
cool O -1 3
place O -1 3

This O -1 3

good O -1 3

needs O -1 3
a O -1 3
significant O -1 3

of O -1 3
work O -1 3
before O -1 3
we O -1 3

After O -1 1
complaining O -1 1
about O -1 1
the O -1 1
chicken O -1 1

the O -1 1
manager B-ASP 0 1
came O -1 1
over O -1 1

tell O -1 1
us O -1 1
that, O -1 1
no O -1 1
one O -1 1
had O -1 1
ever O -1 1
complained O -1 1
before, O -1 1
and O -1 1
that O -1 1
we O -1 1
just O -1 1
didn't O -1 1
know O -1 1
what O -1 1
the O -1 1

a O -1 3

start O -1 3
was O -1 3
incredible O -1 3

the O -1 3

was O -1 3
phenomenal. O -1 3

While O -1 3
certain O -1 3

are O -1 3
excellent O -1 3
(the O -1 3
burger, B-ASP 2 3
some O -1 3

the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
not O -1 3
really O -1 3
the O -1 3
point. O -1 3

While O -1 0
we O -1 0
enjoyed O -1 0
the O -1 0

The O -1 3

just O -1 3
OK, O -1 3

The O -1 3

the O -1 3

Not O -1 3
only O -1 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3

the O -1 3

practically O -1 3
off-the-boat(2), O -1 3
they O -1 3

they O -1 3

all O -1 3
amazing. O -1 3

And O -1 0
their O -1 0
prices O -1 0
are O -1 0
very O -1 0
high(1) O -1 0
- O -1 0
they O -1 0
actually O -1 0
think O -1 0
that O -1 0
they O -1 0
can O -1 0
get O -1 0
away O -1 0
with O -1 0

such(2) O -1 0

menu B-ASP 2 3
consisted O -1 3
of O -1 3
standard(1) O -1 3
brassiere O -1 3

better O -1 3
then O -1 3
places O -1 3
like O -1 3
Balthazar O -1 3

is O -1 3
the O -1 3

(usually O -1 3
the O -1 3
waiters O -1 3
are O -1 3
kind O -1 3
enough O -1 3
to O -1 3
split O -1 3
the O -1 3
dish O -1 3
in O -1 3
half O -1 3
so O -1 3
you O -1 3
get O -1 3
to O -1 3
sample O -1 3
both O -1 3
meats). O -1 3

The O -1 3

I O -1 3
had O -1 3
the O -1 3
onion O -1 3
soup O -1 3
and O -1 3
it O -1 3
was O -1 3
one O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
ever. O -1 3

All O -1 3
the O -1 3

A O -1 0

skip O -1 0
the O -1 0

cake, I-ASP 0 0
roast O -1 0
pork O -1 0
buns O -1 0
and O -1 0

We O -1 3
all O -1 3
had O -1 3
the O -1 3
tasting(1) O -1 3
menu O -1 3
and O -1 3
unlike O -1 3
some O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
other O -1 3
reviews, O -1 3
I O -1 3
felt O -1 3
there O -1 3
was O -1 3
more O -1 3
than O -1 3
enough(2) O -1 3
food. O -1 3

The O -1 3
owner O -1 3
and O -1 3
staff B-ASP 2 3
go O -1 3
to O -1 3
great O -1 3
lengths O -1 3
to O -1 3
make O -1 3
you O -1 3
feel O -1 3
comfortable. O -1 3

Very O -1 3
nice O -1 3
touch O -1 3
that O -1 3
very O -1 3
much O -1 3
fits O -1 3
the O -1 3
place. B-ASP 2 3

Chinatown O -1 3
definitely O -1 3
has O -1 3
better(1) O -1 3
quality O -1 3
with O -1 3
cheaper(2) O -1 3
prices. O -1 3

For O -1 3
the O -1 3
people O -1 3
who O -1 3
want O -1 3
great O -1 3
food B-ASP 0 3
plus O -1 3
great O -1 3

Roxy O -1 3
is O -1 3

AVOID! O -1 3

Great O -1 3

- O -1 3
our O -1 3

of O -1 3
the O -1 3
evening. O -1 3

That O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
problem O -1 0
since O -1 0
we O -1 0
paid O -1 0
about O -1 0
20 O -1 0
bucks O -1 0
a O -1 0
dish, O -1 0
and O -1 0

5 O -1 0

to O -1 0
get O -1 0
a O -1 0

With O -1 0
so O -1 0
many O -1 0
good O -1 0

on O -1 0

I O -1 3
have O -1 3
eaten O -1 3
a O -1 3
lot O -1 3
of O -1 3
pizza B-ASP 1 3
here. O -1 3

In O -1 1
terms O -1 1
of O -1 1
the O -1 1
food O -1 1
itself O -1 1
-- O -1 1
nothing O -1 1
special, O -1 1
we O -1 1
limited O -1 1
ourselves O -1 1
to O -1 1
several O -1 1
appetizers. B-ASP 1 1

The O -1 3
crab O -1 3
cakes O -1 3
are O -1 3
delicious(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
BBQ I-ASP 2 3
rib O -1 3
was O -1 3
perfect(2). O -1 3

And O -1 3
it O -1 3
all O -1 3
comes O -1 3
at O -1 3
a O -1 3
very O -1 3
reasonable O -1 3
price O -1 3
(congee, B-ASP 1 3
noodles, O -1 3
and O -1 3
rice O -1 3
dishes O -1 3
are O -1 3
no O -1 3
more O -1 3
than O -1 3
$3-6 O -1 3
each). O -1 3

They O -1 3
have O -1 3
a O -1 3
very O -1 3
diverse O -1 3
menu B-ASP 2 3
so O -1 3
its O -1 3
something O -1 3
for O -1 3
everybody. O -1 3

A O -1 3
narrow O -1 3
corridor O -1 3
leads O -1 3
to O -1 3
a O -1 3
tiny O -1 3
space O -1 3
where O -1 3
there O -1 3
are O -1 3
three O -1 3
tiny O -1 3
white O -1 3
tiled O -1 3
counters, O -1 3
a O -1 3
great O -1 3
deal O -1 3
of O -1 3
mess O -1 3
(stacks O -1 3
of O -1 3
bottles, O -1 3
cans) O -1 3
and O -1 3
a O -1 3
small O -1 3
counter B-ASP 0 3
holding O -1 3
12-14 O -1 3

Cornelia O -1 3

Story O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
inside O -1 3
of O -1 3
Po O -1 3
is O -1 3
so O -1 3
cool O -1 3
quaint O -1 3
you O -1 3
really O -1 3
can't O -1 3
top O -1 3
the O -1 3
setting B-ASP 2 3
for O -1 3
a O -1 3
romantic O -1 3
dinner O -1 3
in O -1 3
NYC. O -1 3

Bring O -1 3
your O -1 3
date O -1 3
and O -1 3
a O -1 3
bottle B-ASP 1 3
of I-ASP 1 3
wine! I-ASP 1 3

I O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
the O -1 0
chu O -1 0
chu O -1 0
curry O -1 0
and O -1 0
my O -1 0
friend O -1 0
ordered O -1 0
the O -1 0
pad B-ASP 1 0
thai I-ASP 1 0
chicken. I-ASP 1 0

My O -1 1
biggest O -1 1
complaint O -1 1
was O -1 1
the O -1 1
un-tasty O -1 1
food B-ASP 3 1
although O -1 1
presented O -1 1
well. O -1 1

You O -1 0
can't O -1 0
say O -1 0
its O -1 0
cheap O -1 0
because O -1 0
food B-ASP 3 0
is O -1 0
cheaper O -1 0
in O -1 0
Chinatown. O -1 0

A O -1 3
great O -1 3
way O -1 3
to O -1 3
make O -1 3
some O -1 3
money O -1 3
is O -1 3
to O -1 3
buy O -1 3
a O -1 3
case B-ASP 1 3
of I-ASP 1 3
snapple I-ASP 1 3
from O -1 3
Costco O -1 3
and O -1 3
sell O -1 3
it O -1 3
right O -1 3
outside O -1 3
for O -1 3
only O -1 3
$2.50. O -1 3

I O -1 0
would O -1 0
never O -1 0
wait O -1 0
for O -1 0
a O -1 0
table B-ASP 1 0
to O -1 0
eat, O -1 0
it O -1 0
just O -1 0
is O -1 0
not O -1 0
THAT O -1 0
great. O -1 0

Three O -1 3
courses O -1 3
- O -1 3
choices O -1 3
include O -1 3
excellent O -1 3
mussels, B-ASP 2 3

cheese O -1 3
and O -1 3

dressing, O -1 3
and O -1 3
a O -1 3
hanger O -1 3
steak O -1 3
au O -1 3
poivre O -1 3
that O -1 3
is O -1 3
out O -1 3
of O -1 3
this O -1 3
world. O -1 3

The O -1 3
staff B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
unbelievably O -1 3
friendly(1), O -1 3
and O -1 3
I O -1 3
dream O -1 3
about O -1 3
their O -1 3
Saag O -1 3
gosht...so O -1 3
good(2). O -1 3

The O -1 3
ambiance O -1 3
is O -1 3
minimal(1) O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
not O -1 3
phenomenal(2), O -1 3
but O -1 3
some I-ASP 2 3
dishes O -1 3
are O -1 3
quite O -1 3
good(3), O -1 3
such O -1 3
as O -1 3
the O -1 3
eggplant O -1 3
parmesan, O -1 3
veal O -1 3
in O -1 3
carozza O -1 3
chicken O -1 3
saltimbocca. O -1 3

The O -1 0
staff B-ASP 0 0
isn't O -1 0
the O -1 0
friendliest O -1 0
or O -1 0
most O -1 0
competent(1), O -1 0
and O -1 0
I O -1 0
am O -1 0
stickler(2) O -1 0
for O -1 0
service, O -1 0
but O -1 0
everything O -1 0
else O -1 0
about O -1 0
this O -1 0
place O -1 0
makes O -1 0
up O -1 0
for O -1 0
it.(3) O -1 0

After O -1 1
2 O -1 1
tries O -1 1
by O -1 1
the O -1 1
waiter O -1 1
to O -1 1
take O -1 1
it O -1 1
away O -1 1
(we O -1 1
hadn't O -1 1
even O -1 1
looked O -1 1
at O -1 1
it O -1 1
yet, O -1 1
we O -1 1
had O -1 1
full O -1 1
beers B-ASP 1 1
yet O -1 1
to O -1 1
drink), O -1 1
the O -1 1
manager O -1 1
approached O -1 1
and O -1 1
told O -1 1
us O -1 1
they O -1 1
needed O -1 1
the O -1 1
table O -1 1
for O -1 1
people O -1 1
with O -1 1
reservations. O -1 1

Generously O -1 3
garnished(1), O -1 3
organic I-ASP 2 3
grilled I-ASP 2 3
burgers O -1 3
are O -1 3
the O -1 3
most O -1 3
popular(2) O -1 3
dish, O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
Jerusalem O -1 3
market-style O -1 3
falafel O -1 3
wraps O -1 3
and O -1 3
Mediterranean O -1 3
salads--layered O -1 3
with O -1 3
beets, O -1 3
goat O -1 3
cheese O -1 3
and O -1 3
walnuts--are O -1 3
equally O -1 3
scrumptious(3). O -1 3

The O -1 3
fish O -1 3
is O -1 3
fresh O -1 3
and O -1 3
each O -1 3
piece O -1 3
is O -1 3
sliced O -1 3
to O -1 3
perfection O -1 3
and O -1 3
seasoned(1) O -1 3
by O -1 3
the O -1 3
sushi O -1 3
chef O -1 3
(usually O -1 3
with O -1 3
a O -1 3
little O -1 3
fresh(2) O -1 3
wasabi O -1 3
and O -1 3
soy O -1 3
sauce O -1 3

with O -1 3
some I-ASP 2 3
sea O -1 3
salt). O -1 3

The O -1 0
appetizers O -1 0
are O -1 0
ok(1), O -1 0

the O -1 0

The O -1 3
fish O -1 3
is O -1 3
fresh O -1 3
and O -1 3
each O -1 3
piece O -1 3
is O -1 3
sliced O -1 3

seasoned(1) O -1 3
by O -1 3

The O -1 0
price O -1 0
is O -1 0
reasonable O -1 0
although O -1 0
the O -1 0

is O -1 0

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
definitely O -1 3
good, O -1 3
but O -1 3
I O -1 3
left O -1 3
a O -1 3
bit O -1 3
disappointed. O -1 3

Every O -1 3
course B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
better O -1 3
than O -1 3
the O -1 3
next. O -1 3

We O -1 3
have O -1 3
been O -1 3
to O -1 3
this O -1 3
place O -1 3
many O -1 3
times, O -1 3
and O -1 3
always O -1 3
have O -1 3
great O -1 3
food, O -1 3

The O -1 3

was O -1 3
really O -1 3
cool O -1 3
and O -1 3
served O -1 3
us O -1 3
our O -1 3
food B-ASP 1 3
and O -1 3
drinks O -1 3
with O -1 3
a O -1 3

The O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
delicious O -1 3
(I O -1 3
had O -1 3
a O -1 3
halibut O -1 3
special, O -1 3
my O -1 3
husband O -1 3
had O -1 3
steak), O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
service B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
top-notch. O -1 3

There O -1 3
was O -1 3
a O -1 3
great O -1 3

for O -1 3

$8! O -1 3

The O -1 3
bartenders B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
managers O -1 3
are O -1 3
really O -1 3
nice(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
decor O -1 3
is O -1 3
very O -1 3
comfy O -1 3
and O -1 3
laid-back(2), O -1 3
all O -1 3
the O -1 3
while O -1 3
being O -1 3
trendy. O -1 3

The O -1 3
waitstaff B-ASP 2 3
were O -1 3
attentive, O -1 3
polite O -1 3
and O -1 3
helpful O -1 3
- O -1 3
an O -1 3
impressive O -1 3
feat O -1 3
in O -1 3
such O -1 3
close O -1 3
quarters. O -1 3

Overall, O -1 3
the O -1 3
ingredients O -1 3
and O -1 3
technique B-ASP 2 3
are O -1 3
there O -1 3
and O -1 3
I O -1 3
am O -1 3
encouraged O -1 3
enough O -1 3
to O -1 3
return O -1 3
at O -1 3
lunch O -1 3
or O -1 3
dinner O -1 3
to O -1 3
see O -1 3
whether O -1 3
the O -1 3
boldness O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3

improves. O -1 3

The O -1 0

is O -1 0
approximately O -1 0
$25 O -1 0

to O -1 3
this O -1 3

Everything O -1 3
is O -1 3
excellent, O -1 3
the O -1 3
menu O -1 3
is O -1 3
quite O -1 3
extensive, O -1 3
and O -1 3
you O -1 3
eat O -1 3
with O -1 3
a O -1 3
view B-ASP 2 3
on O -1 3
both O -1 3
sides O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3

This O -1 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
perfect O -1 3
date B-ASP 2 3
spot I-ASP 2 3
for O -1 3
Williamsburg O -1 3
couples. O -1 3

The O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
greatest O -1 1
, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I O -1 1
suppose O -1 1
that's O -1 1
how O -1 1
they O -1 1
keep O -1 1
the O -1 1
prices B-ASP 2 1
down O -1 1
. O -1 1

The O -1 0
miso O -1 0
soup O -1 0
lacked O -1 0
flavor O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
fish B-ASP 0 0
was O -1 0
unfortunately O -1 0
not O -1 0
as O -1 0
well O -1 0
prepared O -1 0
as O -1 0
in O -1 0
the O -1 0
past. O -1 0

I O -1 5

an O -1 5

faced I-ASP 1 5
cheese I-ASP 1 5
sandwich I-ASP 1 5
and O -1 5
the O -1 5
manager O -1 5
basically O -1 5
told O -1 5
me O -1 5
to O -1 5
take O -1 5
my O -1 5
business O -1 5
elsewhere! O -1 5

I O -1 0
WAS O -1 0
HIGHLY O -1 0
DISAPPOINTED O -1 0
BY O -1 0
THE O -1 0

I O -1 3
had O -1 3
the O -1 3

which O -1 3
was O -1 3
wonderful. O -1 3

While O -1 3
the O -1 3

is O -1 3
not O -1 3
a O -1 3
hotspot O -1 3

the O -1 3

are O -1 3
unique O -1 3
and O -1 3
pack O -1 3
a O -1 3

for O -1 3
the O -1 3

for O -1 3
the O -1 3

it O -1 3
was O -1 3
a O -1 3

All O -1 3
in O -1 3
all O -1 3
the O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
above O -1 3

I O -1 3
would O -1 3
return O -1 3
to O -1 3

how O -1 3
they O -1 3
operate(2) O -1 3
with O -1 3

The O -1 3

Though O -1 3
you O -1 3

be O -1 3

at O -1 3
a O -1 3

the O -1 3

worth O -1 3
the O -1 3
cramped O -1 3

you'll O -1 3
have O -1 3
fun O -1 3
and O -1 3
forgot O -1 3
about O -1 3
the O -1 3
tight(4( O -1 3
spot O -1 3
you're O -1 3
in. O -1 3

This O -1 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
perfect O -1 3
spot B-ASP 2 3
for O -1 3
meeting O -1 3
friends, O -1 3
having O -1 3
lunch, O -1 3
dinner, O -1 3
pre-theatre O -1 3
or O -1 3
after-theatre O -1 3

In O -1 3
an O -1 3
area O -1 3
sadly O -1 3
lacking O -1 3
in O -1 3
decent O -1 3
Thai B-ASP 2 3
food, I-ASP 2 3
this O -1 3
is O -1 3
one O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
best O -1 3
spots. O -1 3

He O -1 3
takes O -1 3
real O -1 3
pride O -1 3
in O -1 3
his O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
and O -1 3
his O -1 3
business. O -1 3

Then O -1 0
they O -1 0
somehow O -1 0
made O -1 0
a O -1 0
dry O -1 0

burnt O -1 0

The O -1 3

I'm O -1 3

The O -1 3

very O -1 3
fatty(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3

not O -1 3
very O -1 3

Yeah, O -1 0
sometimes O -1 0
the O -1 0

The O -1 3

is O -1 3
delicious O -1 3
- O -1 3
they O -1 3
use O -1 3
fresh O -1 3

instead O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3

common O -1 3
to O -1 3
most O -1 3

I O -1 3
do O -1 3
suggest O -1 3
to O -1 3
ask O -1 3
to O -1 3
be O -1 3

if O -1 3
you O -1 3

be O -1 3
a O -1 3
little O -1 3

Admittedly, O -1 3
this O -1 3
is O -1 3
not O -1 3
the O -1 3

(and O -1 3
thank O -1 3
goodness, O -1 3
in O -1 3
my O -1 3
opinion) O -1 3
but O -1 3
for O -1 3
simple, O -1 3
elegant O -1 3
sushi B-ASP 2 3
there O -1 3
is O -1 3
no O -1 3

a O -1 3

the O -1 3

disappointed(1) O -1 3

they O -1 3
were O -1 3
not(2)! O -1 3

changed, O -1 1

even O -1 1

a O -1 1

any O -1 3

we've O -1 3

lucky? O -1 3

Just O -1 2
bring O -1 2
someone O -1 2

you. O -1 2

My O -1 1

I O -1 0
could O -1 0
barely O -1 0
eat O -1 0
it(1), O -1 0

First O -1 3

Considering O -1 0

the O -1 0

was O -1 0
ridiculously O -1 0

if O -1 4
you O -1 4

While O -1 3

atmosphere O -1 3
were O -1 3
great, O -1 3
the O -1 3

some O -1 5
surprising O -1 5

dishes. B-ASP 2 5

The O -1 0
kitchen B-ASP 0 0
however, O -1 0
is O -1 0
almost O -1 0
always O -1 0

The O -1 3

was O -1 0
poor, O -1 0
restaurant O -1 0
poorly O -1 0
lit, O -1 0
staff O -1 0
not O -1 0
very O -1 0
attentive O -1 0

would O -1 0
have O -1 0
rather O -1 0
eaten O -1 0
at O -1 0
a O -1 0
Mcdonald's O -1 0
than O -1 0
this O -1 0

And O -1 3
the O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
was O -1 3
fantastic. O -1 3

Our O -1 3

and O -1 3
chicken O -1 3
(usually O -1 3
the O -1 3
waiters O -1 3
are O -1 3
kind O -1 3
enough O -1 3
to O -1 3
split O -1 3
the O -1 3
dish B-ASP 1 3
in O -1 3
half O -1 3
so O -1 3
you O -1 3
get O -1 3
to O -1 3
sample O -1 3
both O -1 3

We O -1 3
would O -1 3

a O -1 3
wonderful O -1 3
dining B-ASP 2 3
experience!!! O -1 3

at O -1 3
night, O -1 3
but O -1 3
it's O -1 3
hard O -1 3
to O -1 3
hear O -1 3
your O -1 3
own O -1 3
conversation O -1 3
with O -1 3
everyone O -1 3
else O -1 3
competing O -1 3
for O -1 3
that O -1 3

the O -1 3

playing O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3

Truly O -1 3
the O -1 3
mark O -1 3
of O -1 3
an O -1 3
attentive O -1 3
waiter. B-ASP 2 3

From O -1 3
the O -1 3
spectacular O -1 3
caviar O -1 3
to O -1 3
the O -1 3
hospitable O -1 3
waitstaff, B-ASP 2 3
I O -1 3
felt O -1 3
like O -1 3
royalty O -1 3
and O -1 3
enjoyed O -1 3
every O -1 3
second O -1 3
of O -1 3
it. O -1 3

The O -1 3
place O -1 3
is O -1 3
larger O -1 3
than O -1 3
most O -1 3
and O -1 3
features O -1 3
adequate O -1 3
seating O -1 3
unlike O -1 3
most O -1 3
joints, O -1 3
and O -1 3
has O -1 3
a O -1 3
bar B-ASP 2 3
which O -1 3
deserves O -1 3
a O -1 3
mention. O -1 3

Generously O -1 3
garnished(1), O -1 3

grilled O -1 3
burgers O -1 3
are O -1 3
the O -1 3
most O -1 3

Top O -1 3

that O -1 3

Only O -1 1
complaint O -1 1
would O -1 1
be O -1 1
that O -1 1
at O -1 1
an O -1 1

of O -1 1
$12-$15 O -1 1
per O -1 1

We O -1 1
couldn't O -1 1
carry O -1 1
our O -1 1

the O -1 3

were O -1 3
done O -1 3

and O -1 3
very O -1 3

The O -1 3

was O -1 3
extremely O -1 3
tasty, O -1 3
creatively O -1 3

The O -1 3

while O -1 3
the O -1 3

spectacular, O -1 3
considering O -1 3
the O -1 3

I O -1 3
had O -1 3
the O -1 3
salmon O -1 3

and O -1 3
while O -1 3
it O -1 3
was O -1 3
fine, O -1 3
for O -1 3
the O -1 3
price B-ASP 1 3
paid, O -1 3
I O -1 3
expected O -1 3
it O -1 3
to O -1 3
have O -1 3
some O -1 3
type O -1 3
of O -1 3
flavor. O -1 3

but O -1 1
expect O -1 1
to O -1 1
be O -1 1
delayed O -1 1
15-20 O -1 1
minutes O -1 1
as O -1 1
the O -1 1

seating O -1 1
guests O -1 1
who O -1 1
arrived O -1 1
with O -1 1
a O -1 1

probably O -1 1
had O -1 1
a O -1 1

The O -1 3

is O -1 3
outstanding(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
my O -1 3
crab-cake O -1 3
eggs O -1 3

could O -1 3
not O -1 3
have O -1 3
been O -1 3
better(2). O -1 3

The O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
just O -1 3
OKAY(1), O -1 3
and O -1 3
it's O -1 3
almost O -1 3
not O -1 3
worth O -1 3
going O -1 3
unless O -1 3
you're O -1 3
getting(2) O -1 3
the I-ASP 2 3
pialla, O -1 3
which O -1 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
only O -1 3
dish O -1 3
that's O -1 3
really O -1 3
good(3). O -1 3

never O -1 3
had O -1 3
Edamame B-ASP 2 3
pureed I-ASP 2 3

I O -1 3
thought O -1 3
it O -1 3
was O -1 3
innovative O -1 3
and O -1 3
tasty O -1 3
(could've O -1 3
used O -1 3
a O -1 3
bit O -1 3
more O -1 3
salt). O -1 3

The O -1 3
staff O -1 3
members O -1 3
are O -1 3
extremely O -1 3
friendly(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
even O -1 3
replaced O -1 3
my(2) B-ASP 1 3

once O -1 3
when O -1 3
I O -1 3
dropped O -1 3
it O -1 3
outside. O -1 3

It O -1 3
is O -1 3
far O -1 3
more O -1 3
popular O -1 3
as(1) O -1 3
a I-ASP 2 3
bar O -1 3
than O -1 3
as O -1 3
a O -1 3
restaurant, O -1 3
with O -1 3
only O -1 3
a O -1 3
few(2) O -1 3
tables O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
waiter O -1 3
being O -1 3
the O -1 3
bartender, O -1 3
but O -1 3
we O -1 3
greatly O -1 3
enjoyed O -1 3
the O -1 3
unobtrusive(3) O -1 3

The O -1 3

is O -1 3

at O -1 3

do O -1 3

To O -1 3
be O -1 3
completely O -1 3
fair, O -1 3
the O -1 3
only O -1 3
redeeming O -1 3
factor O -1 3
was O -1 3
the O -1 3
food, B-ASP 2 3
which O -1 3
was O -1 3
above O -1 3
average, O -1 3
but O -1 3
couldn't O -1 3
make O -1 3
up O -1 3
for O -1 3
all O -1 3
the O -1 3
other O -1 3
deficiencies O -1 3
of O -1 3

If O -1 3
it O -1 3
isn't O -1 3
for O -1 3
the O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
(A), O -1 3
it O -1 3
must O -1 3
be O -1 3
the O -1 3
service O -1 3
or O -1 3
the O -1 3
ambience. O -1 3

If O -1 3
you O -1 3
want O -1 3
a O -1 3
casual O -1 3
neighborhood O -1 3
bistro O -1 3
that O -1 3
has O -1 3
great O -1 3
food O -1 3
and O -1 3
excellent O -1 3
service, B-ASP 2 3
this O -1 3
is O -1 3
the O -1 3
place. O -1 3

I O -1 0
had O -1 0
roast B-ASP 1 0
chicken I-ASP 1 0
and O -1 0
a O -1 0
salad. O -1 0

While O -1 3
this O -1 3
isn't O -1 3
classical O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
fare, O -1 3
the O -1 3
chef B-ASP 2 3
has O -1 3
given O -1 3
new O -1 3
life O -1 3
to O -1 3
an O -1 3
old O -1 3
cuisine O -1 3
with O -1 3
some O -1 3
really O -1 3
innovative O -1 3
and O -1 3
tasty O -1 3
dishes O -1 3
that O -1 3
are O -1 3
genuinely O -1 3
Indian O -1 3
without O -1 3
being O -1 3
heavy O -1 3
or O -1 3
same O -1 3
old O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
burn-outs. O -1 3

I O -1 0
stopped O -1 0
by O -1 0
for O -1 0
some O -1 0
brunch O -1 0
today O -1 0
and O -1 0
had O -1 0
the O -1 0
vegan B-ASP 1 0
cranberry I-ASP 1 0

and O -1 0
some O -1 0

The O -1 1
food B-ASP 2 1
is O -1 1
usually O -1 1
good O -1 1
but O -1 1
it O -1 1
certainly O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
a O -1 1
relaxing O -1 1
place O -1 1
to O -1 1
go. O -1 1

Quality O -1 3
of O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
excellent O -1 3
and O -1 3
price O -1 3
is O -1 3
cheap, O -1 3
stick O -1 3
to O -1 3
pork, O -1 3
fish, B-ASP 2 3
chicken, O -1 3
lamb O -1 3
and O -1 3
vegetables. O -1 3

I O -1 0
wasn't O -1 0
thrilled O -1 0
to O -1 0
have O -1 0
to O -1 0
wait B-ASP 0 0
on O -1 0
line O -1 0
for O -1 0
thirty O -1 0
minutes, O -1 0
but O -1 0
I O -1 0
guess O -1 0
that's O -1 0
the O -1 0
price O -1 0
you O -1 0
pay O -1 0
for O -1 0
a O -1 0
popular O -1 0
place. O -1 0

Once O -1 3
they O -1 3
ran O -1 3
out O -1 3

so O -1 3
cool O -1 3
quaint O -1 3
you O -1 3
really O -1 3
can't O -1 3
top O -1 3
the O -1 3
setting B-ASP 2 3
for O -1 3
a O -1 3
romantic O -1 3
dinner O -1 3
in O -1 3
NYC. O -1 3

The O -1 3
location O -1 3
and O -1 3
ambience B-ASP 1 3
is O -1 3
Ok O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
what O -1 3
makes O -1 3
up O -1 3
for O -1 3
it. O -1 3

In O -1 3
fact, O -1 3
while O -1 3
leaving O -1 3
the O -1 3
place O -1 3
we O -1 3
saw O -1 3
two O -1 3
people O -1 3
looking O -1 3
at O -1 3
the O -1 3
menu, O -1 3
and O -1 3
I O -1 3
couldn't O -1 3
help O -1 3
telling O -1 3
them O -1 3
that O -1 3
the O -1 3
food B-ASP 0 3
was O -1 3
horrible. O -1 3

A O -1 0
few O -1 0
tips: O -1 0
skip O -1 0
the O -1 0
turnip B-ASP 0 0
cake, I-ASP 0 0
roast O -1 0
pork O -1 0
buns O -1 0
and O -1 0
egg O -1 0
custards. O -1 0

for O -1 3
about O -1 3
eleven O -1 3
bucks O -1 3
you O -1 3
get O -1 3
a O -1 3
gigantic O -1 3
burrito O -1 3
(or O -1 3
tacos), B-ASP 2 3
margarita, O -1 3
and O -1 3
dessert. O -1 3

The O -1 3
atmosphere B-ASP 3 3
is O -1 3
attractive(1), O -1 3
but O -1 3
a O -1 3
little O -1 3
uncomfortable(2). O -1 3

Service O -1 0
was O -1 0
also O -1 0
horrible O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
ambience B-ASP 0 0
is O -1 0
not O -1 0
that O -1 0
great. O -1 0

my O -1 3

unbeliavably O -1 3
good. O -1 3

The O -1 3
happy B-ASP 2 3

that O -1 3

the O -1 3

I O -1 0
thought O -1 0
the O -1 0

on O -1 0

the O -1 3

The O -1 1
food O -1 1

not O -1 1
very O -1 1

even O -1 1

a O -1 1

There O -1 1

and O -1 3

of O -1 3
the O -1 3

in O -1 3
no O -1 3

it O -1 3

I O -1 3
have O -1 3
been O -1 3
going O -1 3
to O -1 3
this O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
for O -1 3
years, O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
past O -1 3
the O -1 3
service B-ASP 1 3
was O -1 3
average(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
inconsistant(2). O -1 3

The O -1 3
staff B-ASP 2 3
has O -1 3
always O -1 3
been O -1 3
friendly O -1 3
without O -1 3
seeming O -1 3
grating(1), O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
chef O -1 3
has O -1 3
greeted O -1 3
us O -1 3
on O -1 3
a O -1 3
couple O -1 3
of O -1 3
occasions(2). O -1 3

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
fresh, O -1 3
delicious, O -1 3
and O -1 3
reasonably O -1 3
priced. O -1 3

The O -1 3

No O -1 3

who O -1 3
appreciate O -1 3

I O -1 3
was O -1 3
especially O -1 3
impressed O -1 3
during O -1 3
the O -1 3
bday O -1 3
party O -1 3
when O -1 3
the O -1 3
waitstaff B-ASP 2 3
went O -1 3
above O -1 3

beyond O -1 3
in O -1 3
helping O -1 3
me(1) O -1 3
decorate O -1 3

bring O -1 3
out O -1 3

The O -1 1
only O -1 1
weird O -1 1
thing O -1 1
was O -1 1
if O -1 1
we O -1 1
got O -1 1
a(1) O -1 1
bottle, O -1 1
the O -1 1
waitress O -1 1
would O -1 1
have O -1 1
simply O -1 1
multiplied O -1 1
the O -1 1
glass O -1 1
price O -1 1

which O -1 1
makes O -1 1

some O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3

are O -1 3
accurate O -1 3
about O -1 3

noise. B-ASP 0 3

After O -1 3
really O -1 3
enjoying O -1 3
ourselves O -1 3
at O -1 3
the O -1 3

we O -1 3
sat O -1 3
down O -1 3
at O -1 3
a O -1 3
table B-ASP 1 3
and O -1 3
had O -1 3
dinner. O -1 3

We O -1 5
were O -1 5
planning O -1 5
to O -1 5
get O -1 5
dessert O -1 5
but O -1 5
the O -1 5
waitress O -1 5
basically O -1 5
through O -1 5
the O -1 5
bill B-ASP 1 5
at O -1 5
us O -1 5
before O -1 5
we O -1 5
had O -1 5

order. O -1 5

While O -1 0
the O -1 0

also, O -1 3
the O -1 3

small O -1 3
dessert O -1 3
for O -1 3
our O -1 3
celebration. O -1 3

While O -1 3
certain O -1 3
staples O -1 3
are O -1 3
excellent O -1 3
(the O -1 3
burger, O -1 3
some O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
pastas), B-ASP 2 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
not O -1 3
really O -1 3
the O -1 3
point. O -1 3

Prices B-ASP 1 0
are O -1 0
in O -1 0
line. O -1 0

The O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
lousy O -1 0
- O -1 0
too O -1 0
sweet O -1 0
or O -1 0
too O -1 0
salty O -1 0
and O -1 0
the O -1 0
portions B-ASP 0 0
tiny. O -1 0

The O -1 3
service B-ASP 0 3
is O -1 3
ok O -1 3
but O -1 3
could O -1 3
be O -1 3
better. O -1 3

The O -1 0
waiter O -1 0
actually O -1 0
poured O -1 0
water B-ASP 1 0
on O -1 0
my O -1 0
hand O -1 0
and O -1 0
walked O -1 0
away. O -1 0

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 1 3
itself O -1 3
was O -1 3
just O -1 3
ok O -1 3
- O -1 3
nothing O -1 3
spectacular(1) O -1 3
- O -1 3
but O -1 3
the O -1 3
service O -1 3
was O -1 3
awful(2). O -1 3

Drawbacks: O -1 1
service B-ASP 0 1
is O -1 1
slow O -1 1
and O -1 1
they O -1 1
don't O -1 1
toast! O -1 1

We O -1 3
had O -1 3
a O -1 3

definitely O -1 3
do O -1 3
not O -1 3

you(1)- O -1 3
and O -1 3
they O -1 3
kept O -1 3

the O -1 3
whole O -1 3
time. O -1 3

not O -1 0
in O -1 0
a O -1 0
rush, O -1 0
this O -1 0
place O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
bad O -1 0
idea. O -1 0

Meanwhile, O -1 3
the O -1 3

after O -1 3
we O -1 3

we O -1 3
enjoyed O -1 3

I O -1 0

I O -1 3

it O -1 3
was O -1 3
fine, O -1 3
for O -1 3

I O -1 3
expected O -1 3
it O -1 3
to O -1 3
have O -1 3
some O -1 3

the O -1 3

and O -1 3
you O -1 3
can O -1 3

order O -1 3

Besides O -1 1

charged O -1 1

The O -1 0

Their O -1 3

they O -1 3
are O -1 3
a O -1 3
little O -1 3
overcooked(2), O -1 3

not O -1 3
really O -1 3
a O -1 3

the O -1 3
somosas, O -1 3

the O -1 3

but O -1 3
the O -1 3

were O -1 3
kinda O -1 3
dissapointing(2). O -1 3

Cute O -1 3

would O -1 3

The O -1 3
service O -1 3
was O -1 3
attentive O -1 3
without O -1 3
being O -1 3
overbearing(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
each O -1 3
dish O -1 3
we O -1 3
tried O -1 3
was O -1 3
wonderful(2) O -1 3
from O -1 3

the O -1 3

They O -1 3
have O -1 3
a O -1 3
very O -1 3
diverse O -1 3
menu B-ASP 2 3
so O -1 3
its O -1 3
something O -1 3
for O -1 3
everybody. O -1 3

Yet O -1 0
paired O -1 0
with O -1 0
such O -1 0
rude O -1 0

would O -1 0
never O -1 0

promptly O -1 3
at O -1 3
the O -1 3
time O -1 3
of O -1 3
our O -1 3

the O -1 3

I've O -1 1
had O -1 1

my O -1 0

I O -1 0
have O -1 0

the O -1 0
chance O -1 0
to O -1 0

at O -1 0
Orsay O -1 0

When O -1 3
she O -1 3
complained, O -1 3
the O -1 3
waitress B-ASP 1 3
said, O -1 3
Sorry. O -1 3

The O -1 3
menu O -1 3
looked O -1 3
good, O -1 3
except O -1 3
for O -1 3
offering O -1 3
the O -1 3
Chilean O -1 3

but O -1 3
the O -1 3

does O -1 3
not O -1 3
offer O -1 3
up O -1 3
the O -1 3

that O -1 3
were O -1 3
written O -1 3

staff O -1 0
are O -1 0
all O -1 0
Japanese O -1 0
as O -1 0
well O -1 0
and O -1 0
that O -1 0
adds O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
entire O -1 0
ambiance. B-ASP 2 0

The O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
great O -1 3
and O -1 3
they O -1 3
have O -1 3
a O -1 3
good O -1 3
selecion O -1 3
of O -1 3
wines O -1 3
at O -1 3
reasonable O -1 3
prices. B-ASP 2 3

The O -1 3
service B-ASP 3 3
was O -1 3
attentive, O -1 3
yet O -1 3
unimposing(1), O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
was O -1 3
far O -1 3
better O -1 3
than O -1 3
many O -1 3
notorious O -1 3
restaurants O -1 3
in O -1 3
Midtown(2) O -1 3
and O -1 3
the O -1 3
wine O -1 3
list O -1 3
is O -1 3
extensive(3) O -1 3
and O -1 3
well(4) O -1 3
priced. O -1 3

The O -1 1
atmosphere O -1 1
isn't O -1 1
the O -1 1
greatest O -1 1
, O -1 1
but O -1 1
I O -1 1
suppose O -1 1
that's O -1 1
how O -1 1
they O -1 1
keep O -1 1
the O -1 1
prices B-ASP 2 1
down O -1 1
. O -1 1

The O -1 3
pickles B-ASP 2 3
were O -1 3
great O -1 3
addition. O -1 3

I O -1 3
highly O -1 3
recommend O -1 3
visiting O -1 3
this O -1 3
restaurant O -1 3
and O -1 3
having O -1 3
dinner B-ASP 2 3

it O -1 2

my O -1 2
friend O -1 2
who O -1 2
took O -1 2
me O -1 2
there O -1 2
is. O -1 2

I O -1 1
had O -1 1
their O -1 1
eggs B-ASP 0 1
benedict I-ASP 0 1
for O -1 1
brunch, O -1 1
which O -1 1
were O -1 1
the O -1 1
worst O -1 1
in O -1 1
my O -1 1
entire O -1 1
life, O -1 1
I O -1 1
tried O -1 1
removing O -1 1
the O -1 1
hollondaise O -1 1
sauce O -1 1
completely O -1 1
that O -1 1
was O -1 1
how O -1 1
failed O -1 1
it O -1 1
was. O -1 1

Behind O -1 1
this O -1 1
counter, B-ASP 0 1
two O -1 1
men O -1 1
are O -1 1
squeezed O -1 1
in. O -1 1

I O -1 3
only O -1 3
tried O -1 3
a O -1 3
simple O -1 3
dish B-ASP 2 3
of O -1 3
spinach O -1 3
ravioli O -1 3
in O -1 3
a O -1 3
light O -1 3
oil O -1 3
and O -1 3
garlic O -1 3
sauce, O -1 3
but O -1 3
it O -1 3
actually O -1 3
faired O -1 3
better O -1 3
than O -1 3
most O -1 3
NYC O -1 3
Italian O -1 3

I've O -1 3
tried O -1 3
similar O -1 3

While O -1 0
this O -1 0
is O -1 0
a O -1 0
pretty(1) O -1 0
place O -1 0
in O -1 0
that O -1 0
overly O -1 0
cute O -1 0
French O -1 0
way, O -1 0
the O -1 0
food O -1 0
was O -1 0
insultingly O -1 0
horrible(2). O -1 0

My O -1 5
friend's O -1 5
food B-ASP 0 5
was O -1 5
also O -1 5
the O -1 5
complete O -1 5
opposite O -1 5
of O -1 5
what O -1 5
it's O -1 5
supposed O -1 5
to O -1 5
taste O -1 5
like O -1 5
(aND O -1 5
look O -1 5
like). O -1 5

I O -1 4
grew O -1 4
up O -1 4
eating O -1 4
Dosa B-ASP 1 4
and O -1 4
have O -1 4
yet O -1 4
to O -1 4
find O -1 4
a O -1 4

in O -1 4
NY O -1 4
to O -1 4
satisfy O -1 4
my O -1 4

I O -1 0
am O -1 0
a O -1 0
100 O -1 0
lb O -1 0
girl, O -1 0
had O -1 0
a O -1 0

a O -1 0
glass O -1 0

prior O -1 0
to O -1 0
the O -1 0
dinner, O -1 0
and O -1 0
I O -1 0
was O -1 0
still O -1 0
HUNGRY O -1 0
after O -1 0
my O -1 0
visit O -1 0
to O -1 0
this O -1 0
place! O -1 0

this O -1 3
is O -1 3
still O -1 3
one O -1 3
of O -1 3
my O -1 3
most O -1 3
favorite O -1 3
restaurants O -1 3
in O -1 3
the O -1 3
area(1) O -1 3
the O -1 3
food O -1 3
is O -1 3
inexpensive O -1 3
but O -1 3
very O -1 3
good(2) O -1 3
(kimono O -1 3
shrimp O -1 3
special O -1 3
was O -1 3
excellent(3)) O -1 3
and O -1 3
has O -1 3
a O -1 3
great(4) O -1 3
atmosphere. O -1 3

And O -1 3
I O -1 3
would O -1 3
have O -1 3
to O -1 3
agree O -1 3
with O -1 3
the O -1 3
masses(1) O -1 3
in O -1 3
terms O -1 3
of B-ASP 0 3
service O -1 3
- O -1 3
delivery O -1 3
is O -1 3
their O -1 3
Achilles' O -1 3
heel(2). O -1 3

like O -1 3
saying O -1 3
her O -1 3
bread B-ASP 0 3
comes O -1 3
from O -1 3
a O -1 3
special O -1 3
bakery O -1 3
when O -1 3
we O -1 3
have O -1 3
seen O -1 3
her O -1 3
buying O -1 3
it O -1 3
dowtown O -1 3
manhathan. O -1 3

As O -1 3
soon O -1 3
as O -1 3
my O -1 3
father O -1 3
lifted O -1 3
his O -1 3
pen O -1 3
from O -1 3
the O -1 3
check O -1 3
a O -1 3
chef B-ASP 0 3
appeared O -1 3
to O -1 3
usher O -1 3
us O -1 3
out. O -1 3

for O -1 3
an O -1 3
appetizer, O -1 3
their O -1 3
calamari B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
a O -1 3
winner. O -1 3

So O -1 0
we O -1 0
sat O -1 0
at O -1 0
the O -1 0
bar, O -1 0
the O -1 0
bartender B-ASP 0 0
didn't O -1 0
seem O -1 0
like O -1 0
he O -1 0
wanted O -1 0
to O -1 0
be O -1 0
there. O -1 0

I O -1 3
would O -1 3
recommend O -1 3
putting O -1 3
your O -1 3
name O -1 3
down(1) O -1 3
and O -1 3
then O -1 3
getting O -1 3
a O -1 3
drink O -1 3
at O -1 3
a O -1 3
local O -1 3
bar O -1 3
first O -1 3
though(2) O -1 3
because O -1 3
of O -1 3
the O -1 3
wait O -1 3
time. O -1 3

The O -1 3
food B-ASP 2 3
is O -1 3
definitely O -1 3
good, O -1 3
but O -1 3
I O -1 3
left O -1 3
a O -1 3
bit O -1 3
disappointed. O -1 3

I O -1 0
must O -1 0
warn O -1 0
the O -1 0
reader(1) O -1 0
that O -1 0
the O -1 0
portions O -1 0
sizes O -1 0
are O -1 0
very O -1 0
small(2) O -1 0
(especially(3) O -1 0
the I-ASP 0 0

so O -1 0
if O -1 0
you O -1 0
plan O -1 0
to O -1 0
eat O -1 0
until O -1 0
you O -1 0
are O -1 0

do O -1 0

they O -1 5

(the O -1 5

translucent O -1 5

Maybe O -1 0
I O -1 0
say O -1 0
so O -1 0
because O -1 0
it O -1 0
looked O -1 0

was O -1 3
very O -1 3

I O -1 3
ordered O -1 3

that O -1 3
